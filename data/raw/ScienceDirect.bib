abstract = {Biowaste, encompassing food waste and agricultural residues, poses significant environmental challenges while offering transformative opportunities. Traditionally relegated to landfills or incineration, biowaste is increasingly recognized as a renewable resource for producing biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, and animal feed. This review offers a systems-level analysis of biowaste characteristics, conversion processes, and derived bioenergy products such as biofuels, biogas, biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioelectricity, and other valuable chemicals. Diverse conversion methods are explored, including anaerobic digestion, fermentation, microbial fuel cells, pyrolysis, and gasification, alongside conventional practices like landfilling and incineration. Emerging analytical advancements are revolutionizing biowaste valorization. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are highlighted for their transformative impact. For example, AI-driven optimization of pyrolysis conditions has enhanced biochar yield and quality, while predictive modeling using neural networks has improved the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) demonstrates a significant reduction in operational costs through AI-driven process optimization, and life cycle assessment (LCA) quantifies reductions in environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, due to AI-informed process adjustments. Advanced assessment tools, including material flow analysis (MFA), further evaluate resource dynamics within biowaste-to-energy systems. Artificial intelligence and ML optimize waste processing, improving efficiency and product quality. Key analytical tools like TEA, LCA, and MFA assess the financial and environmental viability of these processes.}

However, can human resource professionals rely on algorithms for prediction? Can they decide when the process of prediction is not known? Due to the lack of interpretability, ML models' exclusive nature and growing intricacy make it challenging for field experts to comprehend these multifaceted black boxes. To address the concern of interpretability, trust and transparency of black-box predictions, this study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in identifying the factors that escalate the ECn, analysing the negative impact on productivity, employee morale and financial stability. We propose a predictive model that compares the best two top-performing algorithms based on the performance metrics. Thereafter, we suggest applying an explainable artificial intelligence based on Shapley values, i.e., the Shapley Additive exPlanations approach (SHAP), to identify and compare the feature importance of top-performing algorithms logistic regression and random forest analysis on our dataset. The interpretability of the predictive outcome unboxes the predictions, enhancing trust and facilitating retention strategies.}

In order to reduce emissions, the EU has established reduction targets and adopted new regulations that set emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. A significant area of focus in recent literature has been the reduction of emissions through the utilisation of low-carbon vehicles. This case study aims to develop a Total Cost of Ownership model for low-carbon heavy-duty vehicles. This has been achieved by employing empirical data and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the viability of the available fuel options. The dataset comprised telemetry data collected from January to October 2023 from a Finnish food logistics company utilising low-carbon fuel options. The findings indicate that, within the context of the studied vehicles, liquid biomethane and electric trucks are currently cost-competitive alternatives. In 82% of cases, electric vehicle trucks exhibited a lower total cost of ownership than diesel or liquid biomethane trucks. Electric vehicles were best suited for shorter hauls, typically under 390 km, due to their limited range and thus higher cost per kilometre. Contribution of this paper is empirical demonstration showing that liquid biomethane vehicles offer the greatest overall potential for cost and emissions cost savings compared to diesel and is the most technically feasible option, but it also has the most cost uncertainty.}

This paper investigates how different optimization objectives and varying climatic conditions shape optimal building configurations. This paper explores these performance objectives through an optimization framework that merges genetic algorithms with simulation techniques, leveraging the Energy Plus platform and incorporating embodied impact databases that include energy and carbon emission factors. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation and optimization of operational and embodied energy, as well as carbon footprints. It also highlights the complexities of the energy-carbon relationship across different climate and energy scenarios. The methodology is applied to a representative office building model in two distinct optimization phases in current and future scenarios. The first phase optimizes the interconnected operational and embodied energy, whereas the second phase operational and embodied carbon emissions. Under current weather conditions, the first phase achieves a 28.17 % reduction in total primary energy consumption compared to the original design. In the second phase, the framework results in a 21.85 % decrease in the total carbon footprint. When future weather scenarios are examined, the first phase yields a 26.36 % reduction in total primary energy use, followed by a 17.9 % decrease in total carbon emissions in the second phase. These findings illustrate the significance of optimizing the energy and environmental impacts of buildings in current and future scenarios.}

Identifying the key factors that contribute to successful EMI is critical for improving both content and language learning outcomes for students. In the wake of the recent surge in EMI research, more research synthesis is needed to understand how these factors interact to influence EMI success rather than focusing solely on their isolated, bivariate relationships. To address this gap, we conducted meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) to examine the structural relationships among the key factors affecting the success of EMI. Synthesising data from 50 studies (N = 15,032), our analysis demonstrates that learners’ engagement and English proficiency are pivotal for both content and language learning, with English proficiency being more important for language learning outcomes, although itself considerably also influenced by learners’ anxiety and motivation. Additionally, the moderator analysis shows that learner engagement plays a more significant role in partial EMI contexts, leading to our recommendation for differentiated institutional support in full and partial EMI settings. However, owing to the limited availability of correlation coefficients, some key factors and moderators were excluded, prompting the need for further empirical research to explore these relationships in greater depth.}

Supporting a positive answer to this question, recent research has reported that lateral (left–right) space is automatically activated in lexical decision tasks in which the temporal reference of the words is irrelevant for the goals of the task (implicit tasks). Here, using always the same set of Spanish verbs and pseudoverbs marked for past or future tense, we assess the space–time congruency effect in reaction time and mouse trajectories, both in an explicit time judgement task and an implicit lexical decision task. Moreover, we report the first confirmatory (preregistered) study in this field of research using long lateral movements in lexical decision. The congruency effect was always significant in time judgement, but non-significant in lexical decision. Moreover, in reaction time this effect was significantly smaller than a Smallest Effect Size Of Interest (SESOI) of 10 ms, and even smaller than a recently reported 9 ms effect. Therefore, it was considered negligible. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence for an automatic activation of the lateral mental timeline in lexical decision.}

The term 'mesoporous' signifies that the pore size falls between the microporous range (less than 2 nanometers) and the macroporous range (greater than 50 nanometers). On the other hand, 'Nanohybrids' represent composite materials that amalgamate two or more types of nanoparticles or nanoscale structures to form a novel material with distinctive properties and functions. The exceptional characteristics enable rapid ion diffusion, a substantial specific surface area, and enhanced sites for adsorption and reactions. Consequently, they offer a promising solution for the fabrication of high-performance electrode and catalyst materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices.

abstract = {Background and objective
The Gene Ontology (GO) project has been pivotal in providing a structured framework for characterizing genes and annotating them to specific biological concepts. While traditional gene annotation primarily focuses on mapping genes to GO terms, descriptors of biological concepts, there is a growing need for tools facilitating reverse querying. This paper introduces GOReverseLookup, a novel tool designed to identify over- or underrepresented genes in researcher-defined states of interest (phenotypes), described by sets of GO terms. GOReverseLookup supplements the existing power of Gene Ontology by the possibility of orthologous gene querying across several databases, such as Ensembl and UniProtKB. This combination allows for a more nuanced identification of significant genes across a range of cross-species research contexts.
Methods
GOReverseLookup queries genes associated with input GO terms. Bundles of GO terms encapsulate user-defined states of interest, e.g., angiogenesis. In the second stage of the analysis, all GO terms associated with each gene are fetched, and finally, the statistical relevance of the genes being involved in one (or all) of the defined states of interests is computed.
Results
The two presented use cases illustrate its utility in discovering genes related to rheumatoid arthritis and genes linked with chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. In both cases, GOReverseLookup discovered a substantial number of genes significantly associated with the aforementioned states of interest.
Conclusions
GOReverseLookup proves to be a valuable resource for unraveling the genetic basis of phenotypes, with diverse practical potentials in functional genomics, systems biology, and drug discovery. We anticipate that GOReverseLookup will significantly aid in identifying potential gene targets during the initial research phases.}

The study draws on a design-based research study on process drama in upper-secondary school chemistry teaching which was conducted in collaboration with two teachers. During the process drama, the students and teachers travel in time to explore the uses of plastic; the motives and needs for using plastic as well as the consequences of plastic use in the form of plastic pollution today and in the future. The collected data consist of video- and audio recordings, which were analysed through qualitative content analysis that discerned how the students connected the temporalities, and which dimensions of the plastic problem were made visible in the temporal movements in the process drama. Our findings indicate that the temporal transitions made visible several dimensions of the plastic issue, and contributed to adding layers of complexity to the issue of plastics.}

Within this model, not only is caring not a prerequisite of urban production, but decade(s)in of smartification and platformization practices shows diminishing the spaces, infrastructure, and socio-economic relations that were co-produced to generate care. Through the lens of feminist geography, care is examined as a multidimensional concept encompassing socio-spatial dynamics, power relations, and ethical urban practices. Using empirical data from three research projects, the study showcases alternative digital urbanism practices, categorized into three vignettes: refusal, commoning, and reappropriation. These categories are illustrated with cases such as grassroots food cooperatives, feminist hack-spaces, digital sovereignty initiatives, platform-based welfare experiments and civil society initiatives such as Code for Germany. By situating care within the spatial and social fabric of urban life, the paper argues for its potential as a politic, practice, and epistemology that challenges the exploitative logic of contemporary digital infrastructures. The findings reveal the embeddedness of care practices within local contexts, highlighting the dual need for trans-local networks and territorial embeddedness. This study contributes to the discourse on caring digital urbanism, advancing a feminist theorisation of everyday digital urbanism.}

Hence, significant research has been conducted on modeling, analyzing, and designing various electric motors like Brushless DC Motors (BLDCM), Induction Motors (IM), Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM), Switched Reluctance Motors (SRM), and Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRM) and Permanent Magnet Assisted Synchronous Reluctance Motors (PMaSynRM) for E-mobility applications. These motors face several challenges in modeling, analyzing, and designing, such as handling nonlinearity, accurate thermal modeling, and selecting suitable tools/materials. Also, new motors like Permanent Magnet Synchronous Reluctance Motors (PMSynRM) have been introduced by different EV manufacturers. Hardly any research or reviews are available for dynamic modeling, performance analysis, and design optimization of PMSynRM. Accurate dynamic modeling, performance analysis, and design optimization can support industry and academia in developing improved motor modeling and designs. There is little attention paid to research reviews in the above areas.

Its core goal is to identify and screen out the feature subset that is most critical to the prediction target from the extensive initial attribute collection, in a bid to improve the efficiency and generalization of the model and reduce the computational complexity. A stochastic fractal equilibrium optimizer based on X-shaped dynamic transfer function is targeted for large-scale feature selection. Among them, the X-shaped transfer function is designed based on the scaling and flip changes of the basic transfer functions, and then the parameters related to the number of iterations in the equilibrium optimizer (EO) are further used as time-varying factors to dynamically change the X-shaped transfer function. The flower-shaped transfer function and dynamic flower-shaped transfer function are extended. At the same time, EO is optimized and improved by using the diffusion and updating process in the stochastic fractal search. To assess the efficacy and dominance of the designed FS method, 20 large-scale datasets were picked from UCI datasets for experiments, and SFEO-TF with the best performance was selected and set against 8 other intelligent optimization approaches. The experimental results show that the designed dynamic time-varying X-shaped transfer function is effective as well as the EO based on stochastic fractal search. Among them, in the two groups of controlled experiments, SFEO-TF has the best performance in performance metric and categorization precision, and even the performance of SFEO-TF set against 8 other intelligent optimization approaches in the minimum fitness value of all 20 large-scale datasets has reached the minimum value.}

abstract = {Floating raft is the most widely promoted kelp aquaculture mode in China. Under this mode, kelp production is high, but the ropes are complex and intertwined. The main method of kelp harvesting is manual. To reduce the labor intensity and improve the harvesting efficiency of kelp, this study designs a three-body kelp harvesting ship based on the floating raft aquaculture mode. This ship can lift, transport, collect, and transfer kelp in a single operation. Apart from the manual assistance required for the release and hanging the seedling rope, all other processes are mechanically automated. The diameter and lead of the rotary-screw propulsor blade were determined through Fluent simulation tests. To verify the actual harvesting effect of the three-body kelp harvesting ship, kelp harvesting performance tests were conducted. The results showed that the working speed and efficiency of mechanized harvesting were significantly higher than manual. The mechanical harvesting efficiency was 18.75 times that of manual, and the per capita harvesting efficiency was 9.33 times that of manual. The kelp loss rate of the harvesting ship was 3.25 %, slightly higher than that of manual. This study can provide a certain reference for the mechanized harvesting of kelp in large-scale aquaculture.}

abstract = {Current studies of three-way conflict analysis primarily concentrate on complete situation tables, with limited consideration for incomplete situation tables. This paper focuses on three-way conflict analysis models based on an incomplete Pythagorean fuzzy situation table (IPFST). Following the principles of three-way decision, we propose a 3×3 approach for three-way conflict analysis grounded in the IPFST. The first 3 indicates the support-opposition-neutral triad, which deals with missing values in the IPFST from three different perspectives and is known as a three-way supplement method. We use this method to convert the IPFST into three complete Pythagorean fuzzy situation tables (CPFSTs), which are called the CPFSTs induced by the three-way supplement method. The second 3 represents the agent pairs-agents-issues triad, which is the basic task of trisecting agent pairs, agents, and issues for each part of the first 3. More specifically, we categorize agent pairs into conflict, neutrality, and alliance relations, classify agents into opposition, neutral, and support coalitions, and divide issues into main, secondary, and irrelevant reasons. In addition, we discuss maximum coalitions and feasible strategies for conflict resolution. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the 3×3 approach through a case study.}

Poets, for instance, are often noted for their mental health challenges and elevated suicide rates. This study investigates the link between creativity and suicide among modern and contemporary Chinese poets by employing computational techniques to analyze semantic creativity in their works. Examining 16 poets who died by suicide alongside 21 non-suicidal counterparts, we introduced a dual model that combines flow distance and co-occurrence networks to assess creative cognition. The findings indicate that suicidal poets exhibit significantly higher local and global flow distances, reflecting greater divergent thinking. Furthermore, their co-occurrence networks display more tightly interconnected and efficient structures, suggesting enhanced cognitive flexibility. By demonstrating that heightened creativity, characterized by distinct semantic network properties, is associated with mental health challenges, the study provides empirical support for the "mad genius" hypothesis. These results contribute to the understanding of the creativity-psychopathology nexus, offering novel insights and advancing computational methods for analyzing creative expression.}

Specifically, this systematic review proposed a conceptual framework based on two dimensions (i.e., learner agency, robotic interactivity) and reviewed 92 empirical studies from 2010 to 2023 to clarify four categories of robotic roles, namely learning about robotics, learning through robotics, learning from robotics, and learning with robotics. In learning about robotics, educational robotics are merely the learning objects or contents by learners. In learning through robotics, educational robotics serve as the learning tools or assists, and learners can take their agency to operate or design robotics. In learning from robotics, educational robotics act as tutors to convey and deliver knowledge and information to learners. In learning with robotics, educational robotics serve as the peers or companions of learners and collaborate with learners to provide emotional supports, solve problems and construct knowledge. Furthermore, this study examined the applied educational contexts (i.e., educational domain, educational level) and learning effects of the four robotic roles. Overall, the future development of robotics education highlights both learner agency and robotic interactivity to achieve the goal of a learner-centered, robot-friendly learning.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the critical need for advancing and innovating defuzzification methods in fuzzy inference systems (FISs) for optimal fertilizer recommendation in precision agriculture. Precision agriculture, aimed at sustainable and efficient food production, relies heavily on accurate fertilizer application. Traditional methods often result in over- or under-fertilization, leading to economic losses and environmental pollution. Fuzzy inference systems have shown promise in decision-making for precision agriculture, but the accuracy of fertilizer recommendations hinges on the defuzzification method. This paper introduces a novel framework, the adaptive intelligent fertilizer optimization system (AIFOS), comprising three phases. The first phase enhances the FIS through adaptive membership function design, specifically employing Gaussian membership functions. The second phase introduces data-driven defuzzification innovation, in which parameters are optimized through a hybrid optimization algorithm called hybrid somersault panda search optimization (HSPSO), which combines red panda optimization (RPO) and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO). A multi-objective fitness function is explored to address yield maximization, cost optimization, and environmental impact. The third phase focuses on adaptive knowledge update and feedback, integrating reinforcement learning techniques for real-time learning and adaptation. The proposed framework aims to significantly improve the accuracy, robustness, and sustainability of fertilizer recommendations in precision agriculture.}

Our method leverages multilayer perceptron trained on theoretical EXAFS and validated against theoretical test data and experimental spectra of frequently used nanoparticle types. The network helps lower the correlation between parameters, achieves high accuracy in the presence of noise and glitches, and can provide real-time parameter predictions with minimal user intervention. Parameter uncertainties are estimated as well. This method can be readily integrated into beamline pipelines or laboratory data analysis workflow and has the potential to accelerate high-throughput and catalyst characterization and testing.}

The present study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of AI-powered personalized learning interventions on these key constructs. A total of 183 intermediate-level Chinese male EFL learners were randomly assigned either to an experimental group (EG), which received AI-personalized instruction, or to a control group (CG), which engaged in traditional instruction methods. Data were gathered through pre- and post-intervention surveys and analyzed using independent t-tests. Results indicated that compared to participants in the CG, learners in the EG exhibited statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy, motivation, and digital literacy. These findings offer robust empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of AI-personalized instructional strategies in enhancing essential learner attributes within the adult male EFL context in China.

However, current models struggle with low accuracy, high computational costs, and poor interpretability when detecting faults in insulated bearings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel lightweight spatiotemporal model-based intelligent diagnostic framework, named LSBT-Net, which aims to identify motor insulating bearing faults in practical engineering applications more accurately. Specifically, this research breaks the conventional thinking of “learning fault data feature information” by innovatively developing a spatiotemporal information fusion module. This module is cleverly integrated into the LSBT-Net framework, enabling the extraction of both local and global high-dimensional fault feature information from insulating bearings. At the same time, based on a lightweight design, it significantly reduces the total number of parameters and computational resources required by the framework, thus lowering its computational complexity. The t-SNE algorithm is introduced into the LSBT-Net framework to achieve local or global interpretability. Furthermore, by calculating the gradient information of the LSBT-Net framework on the fault types of insulating bearings through backpropagation, the interpretability of the framework with respect to the physical information is enhanced. Using insulating bearings and typical fault experiments as examples, the LSBT-Net framework demonstrates excellent diagnostic capability and generalization performance compared to other advanced methods.}

As key virulence factors, these toxins cause significant tissue damage and disease manifestations in infected hosts. Vaccination against these toxins through toxoid vaccines, composed of inactivated forms of the toxins, represents a vital strategy for preventing toxin-mediated diseases. However, creating effective toxoid vaccines necessitates meticulous detoxification processes that ensure the loss of toxicity while retaining the immunogenic properties inherent in the native toxins. This review offers a comprehensive evaluation of the diverse methodologies employed for detoxifying bacterial toxins, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and implications for vaccine development. By detailing comparisons of efficacy, stability, residual toxicity, and clinical applicability, we demonstrate that while traditional methods utilizing chemical reagents (such as formaldehyde) remain widely used, emerging technologies like genetic inactivation and protein engineering present significant advantages. These innovations promise to advance the development of durable and irreversible toxoid vaccines that protect public health and contribute to future vaccine formulation improvements. Ultimately, this knowledge synthesis aims to guide future research efforts and facilitate the design of safer and more effective toxoid vaccines to combat the public health threats posed by toxin-producing bacteria.}

This manuscript delves into various nanomaterials and methods-based systems designed to address these drawbacks. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems, including magnetic, gold, selenium, and liposomal nanoparticles, as well as polymeric and mesoporous silica carriers, have demonstrated significant potential to overcome Berberine’s pharmacokinetic limitations. These systems enhance bioavailability, provide targeted delivery, and offer sustained release, showing promising results in preclinical and clinical models for cancer, metabolic, and neurodegenerative disorders. The manuscript also frameworks an in-depth analysis of BBR's underlying pharmacological mechanism, various synergistic studies, clinical trials, and associated patent data. By employing nano-BBR with surface modification, we could sidestep the constraints of traditional forms by attenuating regrettable attributes of BBR. Implementation of combinatorial chemistry, in addition to the in-silico approach, might refine the clinical outcomes of BBR. However, steering into regulatory complexity is important, which may affect its market success because of its physiological drawbacks.}

These models are trained and evaluated on human and mouse benchmark datasets for m1A, m6A, m5C, and A to I, methylation types. Secondly, this work investigates the effect of different encoding techniques on model performance, including one-hot encoding, Gene2Vec, and position encoding, as well as their combinations using concatenation, summation, and multiplication. Thirdly, this study also aims to investigate the prediction strength of motif-based and attention-based classifiers. The obtained results demonstrate that both models achieve high accuracy in predicting RNA methylation sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple performance metrics. Moreover, the selection of encoding strategy has a substantial impact on prediction accuracy; the best approaches vary based on the particular species and type of methylation. The findings also indicate that the motif-based classifier is more stable than the attention-based classification when predicting RNA methylation.

abstract = {The coming of the post-digital workplace? A survey of how white-collar workers experience and cope with digital media reliance. New media technology can both hamper and amplify workers' agency. Much research shows that the ambiguities of digital reliance are accentuated among office workers, especially knowledge workers, who spend most of their working time handling different types of information and data. Thus, in times of constant connectivity, people might feel compelled to create time-spaces for disconnection, or find spatial and temporal routines for restricting their use of digital tools. This article provides a quantitative analysis, based on a survey, of how private and public officials (“white-collar workers”) in Sweden experience and handle digital media reliance at work, with a special focus on whether they think communicative and territorial agency are enhanced or constrained under digitalized working conditions. Based on a principal component analysis (PCA), five dispositions toward (the handling of) digital media reliance are identified: the skepctical, the embracing, the captivated, the reluctant and the disciplined. These dispositions are further analyzed in relation to demographic and contextual variables, pointing especially to the significance of employment sector. While digital media reliance is appreciated and associated with extended agency by many informants, the study also reveals different facets of post-digital sentiments and tactics. These are particularly constitutive of the skeptical disposition, reflecting inclinations to avoid certain media and find alternatives to digital tools, but also in the disciplined disposition which encompasses internalized routines for media use. The study also shows that the normalization of digitalized work processes is entwined with, and necessitates, different forms of territorial micro-politics extending beyond the workplace per se.}

abstract = {Seafloor CO2 sequestration in the form of gas hydrates offers expansive geological opportunities for carbon neutrality strategies. Guided by phase equilibrium conditions, this study employs a self-developed multi-physical simulator to investigate how methane hydrate production beneath a CO2 sequestration zone can facilitate carbon storage. A dual-horizontal-well model is constructed and validated based on field measurements. Through numerical simulations, the effects of methane hydrate production timing, CO2 injection rate, and injection depth on carbon sequestration over a 100,000-year timescale are examined. Two novel metrics—sequestration efficiency and safe distance—are introduced. Results indicate that extracting methane hydrates in the later stages of CO2 injection is optimal. Furthermore, an efficient sequestration window exists for both injection rate and depth. By exploring the relationship between sequestration efficiency and storage safety, this study provides a new perspective for implementing CO2 sequestration pathways.}

abstract = {The implementation of structural health monitoring (SHM) for glass structures is still at an early stage of development. Limited information can be found in existing literature regarding the use of SHM on glass elements. However, recent technological advancements have significantly improved our understanding in this area. Both SHM and the utilization of laminated glasses (LGs) for structural purposes are relatively new concepts with a short history. To conduct a comprehensive assessment of glass elements, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of both glass and SHM sciences. This research aims to explore various approaches for implementing SHM on structural glass elements, with a specific focus on the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. By harnessing the power of ML, the SHM system can analyze large amounts of data collected from sensors placed on glass structures. Furthermore, the application of AI in SHM can facilitate real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and risk assessment for glass structures. The findings emphasize the critical role of early detection in preventing damage to glass elements and demonstrate the effectiveness of SHM in achieving this objective. The use of AI features, such as ML, presents promising opportunities for advancing the capabilities of SHM in the structural glass domain. The incorporation of AI features, such as ML algorithms, could offer additional advantages in this field.}

Few species engage in coalitional aggression, even though the social conditions that would favor its evolution seem to be widespread. Why? Forming coalitions to exploit these opportunities requires individuals to solve highly complex and specialized information processing problems involving cooperation, coordination, and social exchange. The difficulty of evolving cognitive mechanisms capable of solving these problems—especially when the individuals involved are not kin—may explain why multi-individual coalitions are phylogenetically rare. We propose that humans and a few other cognitively pre-adapted species have evolved specialized cognitive programs that govern coalitional behavior, which constitute a distinctive coalitional psychology. To derive a preliminary map of this psychology, we started with a task analysis of the adaptive information-processing problems that arise during coalitional aggression. This exercise can shine light on our evolved psychology because algorithms that motivate and organize coalitional aggression would need design features that solve these problems well to be favored by selection. These problems include decisions about when to form a coalition or join one, when to initiate an attack, and how to allocate the costs and benefits that result from coalitional action. The risk contract of war identifies circumstances under which natural selection would favor decisions to initiate an attack. When the conditions of this model are met, mortality rates will not negatively impact the fitness of males in the winning coalition. This outcome has implications for the design of computational systems that motivate coalitional attacks; it may explain why warfare is so favored an activity among men, despite its risks to the participating individuals' welfare.}

The rising penetration of EVs intensifies interdependencies between urban transport and electric power systems through charging infrastructures. This study presents a novel hybrid energy system that integrates renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines, conventional diesel generators, battery storage, and distribution grids to reliably satisfy the charging demands of electric vehicles in urban environments. A Hybrid Grey Wolf Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HGWCSA), which synergistically combines the exploitation capabilities of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and the exploration strengths of Cuckoo Search (CS), is employed to optimize the system’s sizing and operational performance of the charging system. The primary advantages of HGWCSA include faster convergence, superior solution accuracy, and robust capability to avoid local optima. The effectiveness and innovation of HGWCSA are validated through comparative performance assessments against conventional metaheuristic algorithms. The study further contributes novel insights by thoroughly assessing techno-economic feasibility, socio-economic opportunities, strategic policies, and implementation challenges within the context of sustainable e-mobility from a case study perspective in the Arabian Peninsula. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate that the HGWCSA achieves the lowest Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) at $0.08/kWh and the minimum Total net present cost (TNPC) of $103,267, significantly reducing CO2 emissions compared to traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses validate the optimized system’s adaptability and long-term viability across diverse operational scenarios, significantly advancing sustainable urban transport electrification strategies.}

Evaluating the probability of flutter in compressor blades is an effective approach to quantifying uncertain vibration characteristics and assessing blade aeroelastic stability. To improve modeling accuracy and computational efficiency in this analysis, a prediction method based on the sparrow search algorithm -deep extreme belief network (SSA-DEBN) model is proposed. The proposed method is evaluated through a case study involving the flutter probability assessment of a typical compressor rotor under inlet total pressure distortion. The results demonstrate that the aerodynamic modal damping ratio initially decreases and then increases as the wavelength of the inlet distortion decreases, reaching a minimum when the sinusoidal wave number of the distortion is two. Under inlet distortion conditions, the aerodynamic modal damping ratio of the compressor blade follows an approximate normal distribution, with a flutter reliability of 98.48 %. The primary factors influencing compressor blade flutter are rotational speed, inlet total temperature, vibration frequency, inlet total pressure, outlet static pressure, and distortion amplitude. The SSA-DEBN method has high accuracy and efficiency in the evaluation of compressor blade flutter failure mode by comparative analysis.}

Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences between generative artificial intelligence (AI)-refined and human-written texts in terms of text length, semantic similarity, and linguistic representations. Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models’ prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT’s analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former.

With the growing demand for renewable energy, novel biomimetic humidity-sensitive (HS) actuators are gaining increasing attention from researchers due to their environmental friendliness, simple structure and wide range of actuating stimuli. These biomimetic hygroresponsive actuators are fundamentally structured as composite systems integrating a matrix phase for bulk material continuity and a reinforcement phase optimized for performance amplification. Within this framework, cellulose and agarose (AG)—as naturally derived biomaterials—are engineered as complementary hygroscopic phases—reinforcement and matrix respectively—exhibiting pronounced hygroactuation dynamics with a propensity for spontaneous bending under humidity-driven free energy gradients, quantified by the response/recovery speed (RS/Rec.S). This review, however, reveals through multidisciplinary analysis that these two materials exhibit intrinsic performance advantages in hygroactuator construction without functional coupling dependencies, while simultaneously demonstrating superior interfacial compatibility with diverse material systems. However, such potential remains largely underexplored, particularly regarding AG-based architectures, which poses significant challenges for large-scale commercial implementation. To optimize this protocol, this review establishes its theoretical foundation on representative studies, systematically analyzing the materials' prominent properties from fundamental principles in each chapter, introduces typical processing methods and characterization, and further demonstrates the prominence of each property. Additionally, the paper identifies underappreciated interdisciplinary insights through cross-domain analysis. Finally, Some applications of cellulose/AG-based actuators are given in this paper concisely, anticipates potential challenges in future development, and proposes green, feasible solutions to advance their practical application in humidity-driven technologies.}

The development of drivers-microcystin relationship is of vital importance to microcystin management. However, current practices often focused on the mean response of microcystin concentration and cannot meet the requirement of percentile-based compliance assessment. Despite of many informative studies on the development of drivers–microcystin relationship, there remains a gap between the relationship development and the percentile-based compliance assessment of microcystin concentration. In this study, Bayesian adaptive LASSO Tobit quantile regression (BALTQR) model was introduced to environmental and ecological studies for the first time. The model is specially designed for the prediction of left-censored response variable. We applied the BALTQR model to develop the drivers–microcystin relationship of lakes across the US continent. Based on the results of parameters estimation, Chlorophyll a (CHL), pH, and water temperature (WT) were identified as key drivers to the microcystin concentration. We found that CHL was approximate the same important as pH and both of them had positive effects on the microcystin concentration at all the five regression quantiles. WT was relatively less important and had a surprisingly negative effect at the 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 regression quantiles. We demonstrated that the BALTQR model successfully established the linkage between the development of drivers–microcystin relationship and the compliance assessment of microcystin concentration. We further revealed important implications of these findings to microcystin management. We believed that the BALTQR model has great potential of generalization to model other left-censored response variable in environmental and ecological studies.}

Despite extensive research, viable therapies remain elusive due to complex pathophysiology. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), shows promise in NDD diagnosis and treatment by leveraging vast datasets for accurate predictions. However, because AI models are “black boxes,” explainable AI (XAI) had to be created to make sure that physicians and patients would trust and accept it. Early detection is critical to stop degeneration and make things better for patients. Many in-depth studies on XAI are designed explicitly for NDDs. Existing research does not constantly look at how to interpret NDDs, how to evaluate them, or how to keep them safe. This paper fills in these gaps by looking at and grouping XAI methods for different NDDs, to make them easier to understand and use in medical settings. In this paper, we look at the interpretability methods used in various NDD studies. The methods are split into five groups based on the conditions they are used to treat: Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It organizes XAI methods into groups and talks about their pros, cons, and clinical importance. The study also finds some important research gaps. For example, it says that there are no good security frameworks and that XAI is hard to use in real-life healthcare settings. By giving helpful information and a plan for future research, this paper shows how XAI could change how NDDs are found, treated, and predicted. AI technologies will be used more in healthcare, and this will help us learn more about these challenging conditions.}

Using a quantitative method, we collected data from 452 participants in a healthcare setting across two studies. Our findings showed that AI–employee collaboration can drive AI mastery goal and a paradox mindset. We also found empirical evidence that both AI mastery goal and the paradox mindset can mediate the relationship between employee–AI collaboration and user engagement. Moreover, our findings revealed interesting moderating results across two studies. In Study 1, significant effects were found for both employee–AI collaboration and AI mastery goal at low AI empathy, but not at high levels. In Study 2, while the interaction between employee–AI collaboration and AI empathy was not significant, the influence of AI mastery goal became significant at high empathy levels, and the paradox mindset showed a significant effect only at high levels of AI empathy. These findings provide managers with valuable insights into the essential operations dynamic of employee–AI collaboration, underscoring its important role in enhancing user engagement.}

The results show that the unskilled and unaware effect exists in both grade levels. Furthermore, visual and statistical examination of the data suggest that the pattern of data is very similar in both grade levels. Finally, we further find that perceived motivational quality is associated with judgement accuracy, but also with overconfidence. Perceived cognitive activation is negatively associated with judgement accuracy. Through the usage of two-cohort data, this study applies a novel approach and bears important implications for research on the unskilled and unaware effect. Furthermore, the results regarding the teachers’ behavior provide important insights for educational practice in civic education.}

There is increasing recognition that human-like agents might be natural human collaborators. However, there has been limited work on designing agents according to the principles of human cognition or in empirically testing their teamwork effectiveness. In this study, we introduce the Team Defense Game (TDG), a novel experimental platform for investigating human-autonomy teaming in cyber defense scenarios. We design an agent that relies on episodic memory to determine its actions (Cognitive agent) and compare its effectiveness with two types of autonomous agents: one that relies on heuristic reasoning (Heuristic agent) and one that behaves randomly (Random agent). These agents are compared in a human-autonomy team (HAT) performing a cyber-protection task in the TDG. We systematically evaluate how autonomous teammates’ abilities and competence impact the team’s interaction and outcomes. The results revealed that teams with Cognitive agents are the most effective partners, followed by teams with Heuristic and Random agents. Evaluation of collaborative team process metrics suggests that the cognitive agent is more adaptive to individual play styles of human teammates, but it is also inconsistent and less predictable than the Heuristic agent. Competent agents (Cognitive and Heuristic agents) require less human effort but might cause over-reliance. A post-experiment questionnaire showed that competent agents are rated more trustworthy and cooperative than Random agents. We also found that human participants’ subjective ratings correlate with their team performance, and humans tend to take the credit or responsibility for the team. Our work advances HAT research by providing empirical evidence of how the design of different autonomous agents (cognitive, heuristic, and random) affect team performance and dynamics in cybersecurity contexts. We propose that autonomous agents for HATs should possess both competence and human-like cognition while also ensuring predictable behavior or clear explanations to maintain human trust. Additionally, they should proactively seek human input to enhance teamwork effectiveness.}

abstract = {Vishing – the use of voice calls for phishing – is a form of Social Engineering (SE) attacks. The latter have become a pervasive challenge in modern societies, with over 300,000 yearly victims in the US alone. An increasing number of those attacks is conducted via voice communication, be it through machine-generated ‘robocalls’ or human actors. The goals of ‘social engineers’ can be manifold, from outright fraud to more subtle forms of persuasion. Accordingly, social engineers adopt multi-faceted strategies for voice-based attacks, utilising a variety of ‘tricks’ to exert influence and achieve their goals. Importantly, while organisations have set in place a series of guardrails against other types of SE attacks, voice calls still remain ‘open ground’ for potential bad actors. In the present contribution, we provide an overview of the existing speech technology subfields that need to coalesce into a protective net against one of the major challenges to societies worldwide. Given the dearth of speech science and technology works targeting this issue, we have opted for a narrative review that bridges the gap between the existing psychological literature on the topic and research that has been pursued in parallel by the speech community on some of the constituent constructs. Our review reveals that very little literature exists on addressing this very important topic from a speech technology perspective, an omission further exacerbated by the lack of available data. Thus, our main goal is to highlight this gap and sketch out a roadmap to mitigate it, beginning with the psychological underpinnings of vishing, which primarily include deception and persuasion strategies, continuing with the speech-based approaches that can be used to detect those, as well as the generation and detection of AI-based vishing attempts, and close with a discussion of ethical and legal considerations.}

The purpose of this paper is to solve the heterogeneous multi-attribute group decision making (HMAGDM) problems with attribute values involving real numbers, intervals, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets from the perspective that alternatives have regret psychology with respect to the assessment information and that there is a non-cooperative competitive relationship among alternatives. Therefore a method based on regret theory and interval data envelopment analysis (DEA) game cross-efficiency model is proposed for HMAGDM. The method adopts a process of aggregation followed by exploration. In the aggregation phase, a regret theory-based expert weight determination model is constructed to derive the weights of experts, and the individual decision matrices provided by individual experts are further aggregated into a collective decision matrix. Then, the heterogeneous information in the collective decision matrix is uniformly converted into intervals, which are represented as variables with unknown parameters. According to these variables, a regret theory-based interval DEA game cross-efficiency model is proposed to calculate the comprehensive values of alternatives and thus rank alternatives. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated by a supplier selection example.}

abstract = {Decision making is the process of resolving conflict between different options that vary in discriminability. We study how conflict between the goals of profit maximisation and customer satisfaction determines decision making in the newsvendor problem. The paper consists of three studies which explore conflict from different positions. In Study 1 we show that stockouts cause newsvendor subjects to increase their stocking levels, whereas this effect is absent in a neutrally framed version of the same problem. Conflict is reflected in longer response times under low profit margin, where there is an increased likelihood of ex-post conflict, than under high profit margin. We also find that some subjects are more concerned than others of nonpecuniary factors, and this affects their decision making. In Study 2 we show that an endogenous conflict manipulation affects newsvendor behaviour. We theorise that broad bracketing (reappraisal of the choice situation) should decrease conflict, for which we find some evidence, but we also find that subjects decide less optimally when they use broad bracketing than when they use narrow bracketing. In Study 3 we use a binary newsvendor problem and model the decision process of the newsvendor using the diffusion decision model. The results show that, as in Study 1, the profit margin environment affects how newsvendors respond to conflict. Furthermore, the relative decision evidence towards the optimal choice accumulates at a slower rate after there has been a stockout. Our findings highlight that understanding decision biases in operations should include non-monetary goals, such as avoiding stockouts.}

abstract = {Human speech production is a complex action requiring minute control over the articulators and sensitivity to the surrounding environment. Computational and empirical work has attempted to identify the specific neural mechanisms and cognitive processes that allow us to reliably produce speech sounds. This work has established that humans can use their perception of the auditory and somatosensory consequences of their actions to guide subsequent speech movements. However, speech predominantly takes place in a communicative context, and this context is also known to modulate the way that people speak: human voices are highly flexible. In this paper, we try to unite the traditional motor control conception of internally defined acoustic and somatosensory goals with linguistic research showing that talkers respond and entrain to their conversational partners. We provide an overview of the theoretical and empirical work surrounding the use of sensory feedback monitoring in speech production and discuss practical constraints that have limited more naturalistic investigations into dyadic interaction. To conclude, we argue that the variability of results seen in the speech motor control literature reflects a more complex underlying neural architecture, and an overarching communicative goal that supersedes specific phonetic targets.}

The use of Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels in construction is often constrained by their weight, making handling and installation challenging. These limitations frequently result in on-site planning and manual assembly, increasing risks and inefficiencies. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM), discrete event simulation, and robotic assembly to optimize the installation of CLT structures within the built environment. By leveraging these technologies, the methodology addresses material handling challenges while enhancing construction efficiency and adaptability to urban and prefabricated settings. Numerical simulations and robotic assembly experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the framework’s performance. Results demonstrate an improvement in assembly efficiency, reducing both accident risks and installation time compared to manual methods. Strong agreement between numerical and experimental findings underscores the potential of computational tools in advancing automated construction practices. This research provides actionable recommendations to promote the broader adoption of automated processes in CLT construction, contributing to safer, more efficient, and sustainable building practices within the evolving built environment.}

Grounded in disruptive innovation and social network theory, this study examines whether disruptive events experienced by Chinese manufacturing firms during their digital transformation can reduce green R&D and manufacturing costs, thereby promoting green innovation. Using patent data from China's high-tech manufacturing sector (2014–2023), the study finds an inverted U-shaped relationship between Digital Disruptive Events (DDE) and Green Innovation (GI). The network structure of knowledge and collaboration plays varying moderating roles in this relationship. Structural holes in a firm's knowledge network negatively moderate the effect of DDE on GI, while degree centrality shows no significant moderation. Conversely, more structural holes and lower degree centrality in collaboration networks positively influence GI. The findings highlight the importance of leveraging multilayered network structures to drive green innovation during digital transformation.}

Accurately recognizing these design intentions allows for a more thorough exploration of design processes from the perspective of cognition, facilitating the advancement of intelligent engineering design. Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology has emerged as an effective tool in recent years, which can provide direct insight into designers’ cognitive processes and intentions. However, the current application of EEG technology in engineering design faces difficulties in adapting to multi-task scenarios and rarely targets the design process directly. This study proposed a design intention recognition approach based on Vision Transformer (ViT) and EEG data applicable to multiple engineering design tasks. An image-like representation matrix is introduced to organize designers’ EEG data with the retention of its spatial and frequency features. Then, standard EEG data under different design intentions as well as the EEG data from real design processes is utilized to train and fine-tune a ViT-based design intention recognition model. An experiment workflow for collecting the two types of EEG data is also presented, along with detailed examples of three design tasks. The comparative experiment results and the case study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed design intention recognition approach.}

Using a meta-synthesis approach, this study offers a thorough analysis of datasets and papers pertaining to machine learning applications in gentrification studies from 1979 to 2024. This rigorous meta-synthesis, following a systematic review, screened 217 initial articles, refined to 83 through multi-stage screening including duplicate removal (185), title/abstract (156), and full-text review. By means of this analysis, the study clarifies several facets of gentrification from three main angles: important causes, spatial effects, and algorithmic applications. A strong conceptual framework that takes into account the connections between important indicators is offered, offering a comprehensive comprehension of the phenomenon. The results demonstrate how machine learning may be used to predict future events and spot gentrification patterns. Three main axes drive this predictive capability: first, supervised learning models that use social, economic, environmental, and physical-spatial indicators to predict gentrification; second, unsupervised learning methods that find similar neighborhoods and uncover underlying patterns; and third, hybrid learning methods that combine both supervised and unsupervised approaches (such as semi-supervised learning and ensemble methods) to leverage their complementary strengths in handling multidimensional urban data and enhancing prediction robustness. These advancements enable more in-depth analyses of urban dynamics and a deeper comprehension of the complexities of gentrification. This study provides policymakers with a foundation for developing workable strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of gentrification and advance sustainable urban growth. Furthermore, by identifying research gaps and suggesting possible avenues for future work, the study broadens the scope of the subject and contributes to the development of new ideas and empirical research on urban gentrification. This in-depth examination highlights how crucial machine learning is to understanding and managing urban change, as well as how it may promote evidence-based planning and equitable urban growth.}

abstract = {Calibration is, and will remain, an integral component of radio interferometric data reduction. However, as larger, more sensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration problem grows in both size and difficulty. The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales quadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new instruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their predecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more challenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images) which would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic range and, ultimately, the derived science. It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package implementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves upon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance. Whilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger derivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary length chains of parameterized gain terms. QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to express calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs can (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware configurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer hardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster. QuartiCal’s qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations of PSR J2009-2026. These qualitative results are followed by an analysis of QuartiCal’s performance in terms of wall time and memory footprint for a number of calibration scenarios and hardware configurations.}

With the rapid development of e-commerce industry, precision marketing has become a key means for enterprises to enhance competitiveness and profitability. However, traditional marketing methods often cannot accurately identify the characteristics of customers, leading to the waste of e-commerce resources. In this context, e-commerce enterprises urgently need a more accurate and efficient marketing method to meet the growing business needs. To this end, this study attempts to optimize the traditional K-means algorithm, and fundamentally improve the clustering effect in precision marketing by optimizing the selection of initial clustering centers and similarity measurement methods. Based on this, the research constructs an e-commerce marketing system based on HC-means algorithm to more accurately divide customer groups, identify high-value customers, potential customers and lost customers, and formulate differentiated marketing strategies for different groups. Experiments show that the average accuracy of HC-means algorithm in Glass database is 93.71, which is 15.48-15.79 higher than the highest accuracy of other two kinds of algorithms in the same kind of database. When the cluster number is 8, the Mahalanobis distance of HC-Means is reduced by 2.1 and 1.2 respectively compared with K-means and DBSCAN, which indicates that the clustering results are more reasonable in data distribution. When the cluster number is 3, more than half of the customers' consumption interval days are mainly concentrated between 8-12 days, and about 10% of the customers make purchases every 2 days. These accurate customer behavior insights provide a strong basis for marketing strategy development. To sum up, the HC-Means system constructed by the research has achieved remarkable results in e-commerce precision marketing, greatly improving user satisfaction, and providing a valuable reference scheme for e-commerce enterprises to optimize marketing mode and achieve sustainable development.}

The debate persists on whether language and thought are distinct entities or if language is deeply embedded in individual cognitive processes. This study employs adjective cues combined with a mental imagery size judgment task as an experimental paradigm, utilizing neurophysiological techniques to preliminarily explore the role of adjectives in size judgment tasks and their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Findings reveal that performance is best when adjectives are congruent with the size of the object, with EEG microstate results indicating strong activity in Class A, related to language networks under this condition. Additionally, when adjectives conflict with object size, the discovery of the Ni component suggests that individuals monitor and inhibit the conflict between adjectives and object size, leading to decreased task performance in this condition. Moreover, when object size is ambiguous, individuals' size judgments do not benefit significantly from clear adjective cues. Event-related potentials and EEG microstate results suggest that under this condition, top-down cognitive resources are recruited more extensively. In conclusion, language plays a more crucial role in simpler judgment tasks; as tasks become more complex, judgment processes engage a greater number of distributed brain regions to collaborate, while the language system remains active. This study provides initial cognitive neuroscience evidence for understanding the relationship between language and simple forms of thought, offering preliminary insights for future investigations into the connection between language and thought.}

Through a combination of static gelation experiments and core flow experiments, the thickening performance and seepage characteristics in porous media of the novel HDS system was studied. Considering the viscosity changes and dynamic chain extension reactions of the HDS system, the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) micro-continuum approach was applied to develop a multi-physical mathematical model for the migration of HDS system in a pore-throat network. Therefore, a 4-meter core experiment and multi-scale numerical modeling were conducted to analyze the dynamic chain extension efficiency and spatial distribution characteristics of the HDS system. Additionally, machine learning techniques were used to define the dynamic chain extension reaction index (RI) and identify its critical threshold, exploring the effects of varying injection parameters, solution concentrations, and permeabilities on the chain extension behavior. Results show that HDS molecular chains form aggregated structures that evolve into a unique spatial network. As the network structure becomes denser, the viscosity of HDS system increases rapidly. As the core permeability increases, the core throat size enlarges, and the compatibility between the HDS system molecular aggregates and the pore throat improves. HDS system shows good transmission performance during migration in the long core. Numerical simulations and machine learning techniques were employed to define the dynamic chain extension RI, examining how RI changes under varying injection parameters, solution concentrations, and permeabilities. As permeability, HDS system concentration, and injection rate increase, the RI also increases. The results are presented in the RI graph, offering theoretical insights for deep profile adjustment and the development of reagent systems.}

A steady-state ARS model was established using Simulink to comprehensively analyze the impacts of parameters including heat source water, cooling water, and chilled water on the system's coefficient of performance (COP). The investigation revealed that elevated heat source water temperatures significantly enhance refrigeration performance, while increased cooling water temperatures cause synchronous reductions in both cooling capacity and COP. Chilled water flow rate variations demonstrate negligible effects on COP. Furthermore, an ARS laboratory test platform was constructed and validated through indoor experiments, incorporating environmental parameters from an ongoing high geothermal tunnel project and numerical simulation results. The findings demonstrate excellent agreement between computational predictions and experimental data, confirming the robust adaptability of the designed ARS under the specific tunnel conditions. In summary, this research establishes a theoretical foundation for resourceful utilization of high geothermal heat hazards, contributing to green construction practices and sustainable development in tunneling engineering.}

We demonstrate that this system features highly localized states with a spin-polarized semiconducting configuration.

In the first part of the article, some Lyapunov-like sufficient conditions are derived to stabilize an impulsive system within the prescribed-time, where impulsive instants are obtained through an event-triggered mechanism. Unlike event-triggered control, event-triggered impulsive control executes solely when the event is generated. The second part of the article provides sufficient Lyapunov-like criteria for the prescribed-time stability of impulsive systems via a self-triggered mechanism. Contrary to the event-triggered impulsive control, where triggering instants are obtained through continuous or periodic monitoring of the event-triggering conditions, the proposed self-triggered impulsive control strategy can estimate the next triggering instant by the information available in the currently triggered instant. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from both of the proposed mechanisms.

Traditional signal coordination methods face challenges in ensuring efficient traffic flow on long arterials due to urban expansion and complex spatiotemporal variations. However, existing methods struggle to achieve effective signal coordination under complex spatiotemporal variations, and lack methodological framework for universally applicable green wave coordination. To address this, a spatiotemporal partitioning-based green wave trajectory feature coordination optimization model is proposed. First, temporal partitioning is performed using an improved Fisher optimal segmentation method, while spatial subarea division is achieved via an enhanced K-Medoids algorithm. For each subarea, an arterial traffic signal control model is established based on green wave trajectory characteristics. Phase difference coordination equations are then applied to synchronize adjacent subareas. The model is validated on Foshan’s Lvjing Road, with evening peak performance compared against a classical green wave trajectory approach. Results indicate that the proposed model reduces vehicle average delay by 13.18% and the number of stops by 18.05%.}

Cognitive impairment is a prominent feature in the clinical presentation of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with MDD have brain structural and functional abnormalities. However, the association between such abnormalities and cognitive function remains unclear.
Methods
For this research, 105 patients with treatment-naïve first-episode MDD and 53 healthy controls (HCs) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessment. The MRI main indicators included sulcus depth (SD), local gyration index (LGI) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) was used for neuropsychological assessment. The support vector machine (SVM) was used to assess the accuracy of the classification.
Results
Compared with the HCs, the patients with MDD had significant decreases in five dimensions of the MCCB, as well as in SD in the left superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal cortex, but had an increases in LGI in the left precuneus cortex and pericalcarine cortex and ALFF of the left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. In addition, the visual learning score (one MCCB dimension) was negatively associated with the SD of the left superior temporal sulcus and positively associated with the ALFF of left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. The SVM has a relatively good ability to distinguish patients with MDD and HCs.
Conclusion
Cognitive impairment in patients with MDD was associated with abnormal an SD and ALFF. These findings help to further understand cognitive impairment in patients with MDD.}

However, product safety refers not only to known but also to unknown or hidden hazards that are very important to know and avoid. Shortcomings and limitations of currently used technologies seem to cause an obvious discrepancy between intended and actual consumer protection. Products are not as safe as claimed by stakeholders. An existing but overlooked proactive safety screening with a prioritization strategy is brought into focus as it offers a unique solution. It can handle the complexity of a product with thousands of compounds of unknown identity and unknown toxicity and can figure out the important hazardous compounds, both known and unknown. Using hardly any sample preparation and the effect detection at an early position in the workflow is a game changer not to overlook hazardous compounds. All analytical technologies are needed, but the key is the re-arrangement of the instrument order, i.e. firstly hazard-related screening (effect first) and secondly, focus on identification of prioritized hazardous compounds. Such a proactive safety screening revealed previously unknown hazardous compounds in products on the market claimed to be safe. The highly sustainable, affordable, and all-in-one 2LabsToGo-Eco with easy-to-use planar bioassays empowers stakeholders to implement proactive safety screening and dynamic risk management. The transition to greater efficacy in consumer protection needs incentives and the critical review aims to stimulate a debate.}

This framework, rooted in historical philosophical distinctions between qualities, gave rise to the ‘binding problem’: how the brain integrates these separately processed features into coherent percepts. We present converging evidence from electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and lesion studies that challenges this framework. We argue that the binding problem may be an artifact of theoretical assumptions rather than a real computational challenge for the brain. Drawing insights from deep neural networks (DNNs) and recent empirical findings, we propose a framework where the visual cortex represents naturally co-occurring patterns of information rather than processing isolated features that need binding.}

Traditional measures often link reliance to decision-making outcomes, which may not be suitable for complex problem-solving tasks where outcomes are not binary (i.e., correct or incorrect) or immediately clear. Therefore, this study aims to develop a scale to measure undergraduate students’ behaviors of using Generative AI during problem-solving tasks without directly linking them to specific outcomes. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on 800 responses collected after students finished one problem-solving activity, which revealed four distinct factors: reflective use, cautious use, thoughtless use, and collaborative use. The overall scale has reached sufficient internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .84). Two confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to validate the factors using the remaining 730 responses from this activity and 1,173 responses from another problem-solving activity. CFA indices showed adequate model fit for data from both problem-solving tasks, suggesting that the scale can be applied to various human-AI problem-solving tasks. This study offers a validated scale to measure students’ reliance behaviors in different human-AI problem-solving activities and provides implications for educators to responsively integrate Generative AI in higher education.}

Traditional product design processes often struggle to accurately capture complex user needs and generate market-relevant solutions due to a heavy reliance on subjective human input and limited decision support tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in various domains, their application in product design remains limited, often resulting in generic outputs. To address this, we propose an innovative paradigm for intelligent product design generation, termed ProdGen. The core of ProdGen is the ProdGen-Agent system, which integrates LLMs with customized expert design tools, leveraging the proposed Multi-Design Task Adapter (MDT-A) method and a Dual Knowledge Enhancement Mechanism. The MDT-A method injects multimodal design task knowledge into LLMs through a unified knowledge fusion framework, enabling enhanced task decomposition and efficient interaction with custom design tools. The Dual Knowledge Enhancement Mechanism enriches LLM performance by incorporating domain-specific knowledge bases and structured graph-based data retrieval, ensuring more accurate and relevant design outputs. Demonstrated through kitchen design cases, ProdGen-Agent autonomously handles the entire design process, excelling in user need analysis, task breakdown, decision-making support, tool integration, and multidimensional design generation. Expert evaluations validate ProdGen-Agent’s effectiveness in automating complex design tasks, confirming its potential to revolutionize product design processes across various industries by leveraging LLMs in combination with domain expertise.}

Simple, practical strategies for overcoming BU issues are proposed assessing a range of techniques, with results demonstrating a powerful potential for RAM performance to be improved upon through only small adjustments to initial sample conditions. Several anomalous results and behavior are reported which have eluded mechanistic understanding through conventional means. In the course of pursuing a unified theory capable of correct mechanistic interpretations of RAM results, a fresh perspective is offered from a refined theoretical development of RAM-specific principles, and mechanisms such as vibrational forcing and exponential amplification are proposed. By investigating the roles of RAM operational mechanics and fundamental acoustic principles, satisfactory explanations can begin to be obtained. By considering these facets to RAM mixing processes, microscale mixing potential was increased by a factor of 4x and allowed for homogeneity to be established at 150 μg using a semi-fine CAF sample and extend to levels down to at least 32.5 μg.}

As an important part of the switchgear, basin-type insulators will seriously affect the reliability and safety of the switchgear operation in case of failure such as breakage or partial discharge. There are still many limitations in the current risk assessment methods for basin-type insulators, resulting in inaccurate risk identification and classification. Therefore, this paper proposes an extended failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) based on the defects of traditional FMEA model based on regret theory(RT), group satisfaction index and the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method to assess the failure mode of basin-type insulators. First, the expert applies the 5Why analysis to obtain the failure modes of basin-type insulators. Then the risk assessment information given by the experts in uncertain linguistic terms (ULT) is assembled by probabilistic uncertain linguistic terms sets (PULTSs). Secondly, in order to improve the accuracy of the expert group information during the calculation, this paper proposes a new group satisfaction index for describing the degree of satisfaction and disagreement of expert opinions, and constructs a PUL-MEREC-SWARA integrated weight acquisition method based on this index for determining the weights of risk factors. Finally, in order to improve the accuracy and stability of the ranking, a new PUL-RT-CoCoSo integrated decision framework is proposed to rank the importance of failure modes in a more rational way. The stability, validity and superiority of the proposed model are demonstrated through the sensitivity analysis of parameters and comparison with several typical ranking methods.}

Communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity are 21st-century skills required to be developed in educational settings from an early age. Robotics seems to contribute to that. Therefore, this study focuses on kindergarten and explores the current research trends regarding children's development of these skills via robotics. It aims to a) construct links between the main factors in the existing research, b) map the related field, and identify gaps to enhance our understanding. In this context, a bibliometric analysis using the Bibliometrix package and CiteSpace and a content analysis utilizing the Atlas.ti Software is employed covering 203 of 3822 studies conducted between 2014 and December 2024. Based on the findings, the most frequently examined topics are social-anthropomorphic robots, human-robot interaction, and computational thinking under the umbrella of educational robotics and skills development. The highest publication performance belongs to the USA, Italy, Japan, China, and Greece. The strongest sources are ACM, IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, the Education and Information Technologies Journal, the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, and the Computers and Education Journal. Besides, Papert, Wing, and Bers arise as the most influential authors. Furthermore, most studies explore one or two C-skills, examining critical thinking the most and creativity the least during interventions focused on several domains but rarely on skills promotion. Moreover, most researchers choose the qualitative method, using small sample sizes, wheeled, floor robots, and various learning theories in short-term interventions. Finally, robots are utilized as assistive instruction kits, teammates, and educators’ assistants while children act as researchers-constructors.}

This approach considers various indicators, including cost, environmental impact, and societal factors when designing bridges. This shift enables a comprehensive assessment of structural resilience by examining the bridge's ability to endure various hazards throughout its lifespan. This study provides a comprehensive review of two key research domains that have emerged in the field of bridge life-cycle analysis, namely life-cycle sustainability (LCS) and life-cycle performance (LCP). The discussion on the LCS of bridges encompasses both assessment-based and optimization-based studies, while the exploration of LCP focuses on research examining structures subjected to deterioration over their service life due to deprecating phenomena such as corrosion and relative humidity changes, as well as extreme hazards like earthquakes and floods. Moreover, this study discusses the integration between LCS and LCP, highlighting how combined consideration of these factors can minimize damage costs, improve resiliency, and extend the lifespan of the structure. A detailed evaluation encompasses various life-cycle metrics, structural performance indicators, time-dependent modelling techniques, and analysis methods proposed in the literature. Additionally, the research identifies critical gaps and trends in life-cycle analysis within the realm of bridge engineering, providing a concise yet thorough overview for advancing considerations in the life-cycle design of bridges.}

abstract = {Negative episodic memories exert important control of behavioral responses during a real or anticipated threatening situation. Under pathological states, however, this control can extend to non-threatening scenarios. For example, pathological states of aversive memory involve fear-overgeneralization in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders. Furthermore, negative bias in cognitive processing and memory formation is seen in depressed individuals displaying enhanced encoding and recall, less forgetting or repetition of negative memory (rumination) as well as impaired recall of positive memory. Beyond pathological conditions, researchers have long aimed to understand the basic biological entity of memory. This unit termed “engram” is the cellular and molecular component of enduring physiological changes in the brain, enabling learning and memory retrieval. Herein, the hippocampus is central in the formation of context-dependent episodic memories and therefore most often studied in animal experiments to elucidate complex memory traces. In addition, the hippocampus is critically involved in fear-circuits and stress-related dysfunction. This review summarizes current knowledge about memory engrams in hippocampal (sub)regions and their functional relevance regarding neuronal correlates and rodent behavior. A special focus is placed on the negative valence of a memory and the formation of engrams for aversive memories, specifically induced by fear or stress. Finally, limitations of current engram research and possible future directions to improve our understanding of negatively valued memory and its implications in neuropathological conditions will be discussed.}

Understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying creative thought is essential for fostering individual creativity. While previous studies have demonstrated that exploratory behavior positively influences creative performance, few studies investigated the relationship between creativity and exploration at the neural level. To address this gap, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis comprising 80 creativity experiments (1,850 subjects) and 23 exploration experiments (646 subjects) to examine potential shared neural activations between creativity and exploration. Furthermore, we analyzed the neural similarities and differences among three forms of creative thinking—divergent thinking (DT), convergent thinking (CT), and artistic creativity—and their relationship with exploration. The conjunction analysis of creativity and exploration revealed significant activations in the bilateral IFJ and left preSMA. Further conjunction analyses revealed that both CT and artistic creativity exhibited common neural activations with exploration, with CT co-activating the left IFJ and artistic creativity co-activating both the right IFJ and left preSMA, while DT did not. Additionally, the conjunction analyses across the three forms of creativity did not identify shared neural activations. Further functional decoding analyses of the overlapping brain regions associated with CT and exploration, as well as artistic creativity and exploration, revealed correlations with inhibitory control mechanisms. These results enhance our understanding of the role of exploration in the creative thinking process and provide valuable insights for developing strategies to foster innovative thinking.}

Previous research shows that many people who have experienced flooding exhibit a greater preparedness to act on climate change, especially when the experience relates to more pronounced emotional responses. However, this research has mainly focused on general negative emotional reactions to flooding. Here, we re-analysed a large UK survey dataset (N = 1997) using mixed-methods to examine discrete emotional responses to flooding, including positive emotions, and their relationship with environmental intentions and policy support. Whilst anxiety, anger, helplessness, and distress, dominate people’s experience, positive emotions were also reported as significantly higher in our flooded group, particularly gratitude and pride in response to the receipt of external and community support; surprise was also observed. Thematic analysis highlighted perceived impacts of flooding, and the experience of positive support, as being key to alleviating distress and anxiety, as well as promoting subsequent positive long-term actions to reduce flooding. Notably indirect experience of flooding was also impactful with a range of emotional responses also reported by observers. Regression analysis indicated that higher levels of anxiety, distress, and gratitude were associated with greater intentions to act environmentally in the future (alongside greater levels of anger and lower levels of indifference), and to support for environmental policies (alongside greater levels of sympathy). We suggest that the provision of support following flooding may promote considerations of morality and climate change and increase the likelihood (of both recipients and observers) to undertake pro social and pro-environmental behaviour themselves in the future.}

abstract = {Motivation
Many cancers overexpress low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), facilitating cholesterol metabolism for tumour growth. Targeting LDLR offers a promising strategy for selective drug delivery. Orlistat, a fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, has shown anti-cancer potential, particularly in tumours with high FAS expression. This study introduces an LDLR-Orlistat Targeted Nanoparticles (LDLR-OTNs) to enhance cancer cell uptake via LDLR-mediated endocytosis. The objectives include synthesizing lipid-based orlistat nanoparticles, functionalizing them with an 11-mer LDLR-binding peptide, assessing uptake and cytotoxicity in three LDLR- and FAS-expressing breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, MDA MB 453, MCF-7), and comparing uptake kinetics with non-targeted nanoparticles.
Methods
Orlistat nanoparticles (ONs) were synthesised via rapid solvent exchange, producing uncoated ONs, POPC-coated ONs (POPC-ONs), and LDLR-targeted ONs (LDLR-OTNs). Targeting was achieved by conjugating an 11-mer binding peptide (RLTRKRGLKLA) to DSPE-PEG5000 maleimide via click chemistry, confirmed by Ellman’s test. Nanoparticles were characterised using DLS and TEM. Cellular uptake over 24 hours was assessed using fluorescence-labelled POPC-ONs and LDLR-OTNs, and uptake kinetics were analysed. Suramin-blocking studies were used to confirm LDLR-mediated uptake. A 48-hour cytotoxicity assay quantified IC50 values in the aforementioned cell lines.
Results
TEM data showed that LDLR-OTNs (33 nm) were smaller than untargeted POPC-ONs (58 nm) and uncoated ONs (67 nm). Ellman’s test confirmed > 99.2% peptide conjugation. Cellular uptake of LDLR-OTNs was rapid, with significant fluorescence by 1 hour and a kinetic plateau at 24–48 hours, with data fitting to a modified exponential model, while that of untargeted POPC-ONs had lower initial uptake, following a logistic model. Suramin blocking reduced LDLR-OTN uptake, confirming receptor-mediated entry. Cytotoxicity assays yielded IC50 values of 23.8 µM (BT-474), 25.8 µM (MDA MB 453), and 8.2 µM (MCF-7), with maximal inhibition at 48 h.
Conclusions
LDLR-OTNs demonstrated receptor-mediated uptake and potent cytotoxicity in LDLR- and FAS- overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings support LDLR-targeted nanoparticles as a promising approach for delivering FAS inhibitors to LDLR-rich tumours, meriting further investigation in targeted cancer therapy development.}

However, the complexity of AI ethics makes it hard to pin down what to teach, how to teach it, and how to assess its effectiveness. Drawing on an educational perspective, this paper presents a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of the early years of AI ethics education as a formalized field to analyze whether its future trajectory is aligned with educational best practices. Our review highlights core challenges in AI ethics education and the content, assessment, and pedagogy used in real interventions over recent years. We find that efforts to teach AI ethics do helpfully draw on a holistic view (as opposed to a narrow view), and utilize progressive pedagogies like case studies and group projects that aim to meaningfully challenge students’ ethical reasoning skills in applied practices. However, many real- world AI ethics teaching interventions do not leverage well-supported assessment techniques known to support student learning; rather, assessment is conducted primarily for research evaluative purposes. This gap in rigorous assessment raises implications for researchers and practitioners, as responsible development and use of AI will be stymied if educators cannot successfully determine whether students have truly learned relevant AI ethics content or skills.}

abstract = {In daily life, individuals are influenced by the behaviors of others. The question of how far-reaching this social influence extends to travel behaviors has received significant attention in recent decades, through the capture of dyadic interaction effects that may exist among individuals. Along these lines, in the current study, we apply a Spatial-Attitudinal Probit Model (SAPM) that assumes an autoregressive lag structure in the utilities underlying individuals’ travel mode choice, specifically focusing on the choice between car and public transportation for commuting trips. Notably, the magnitude of interdependency among decision agents is measured by a global weight matrix, accounting for a dual source of influence: (1) spatial proximity, measured as the Euclidean distance between individuals’ residential locations, and (2) attitudinal similarities, specifically perceptions regarding sustainable mobility and environmental awareness. To our knowledge, this represents the first application of an autoregressive travel mode choice model accounting for both geographical and attitudinal proximity as simultaneous sources of interaction. The dataset for our analysis includes 2,347 observations, corresponding to the one-way commute trips of 2,347 individuals, as reported during a survey conducted between October 2019 and January 2020 in the metropolitan area of Cagliari, Italy. Our results reveal the significant role of social autoregressive parameters and the presence of interdependency effects among individuals’ commute mode choices. The utilization of a social lag structure allows for the separate identification of direct and indirect effects of explanatory variables. Notably, around 40% of the total effect is attributed to the indirect effects arising from individuals’ social interdependencies. This finding holds important implications for evaluating and planning potential future measures aimed at increasing public transit usage.}

These countries are further subdivided into regions for further examinations. Based on the global dataset, the study concludes that the number of female business owners across the study sample significantly contribute to poverty reduction. It is pertinent to emphasize that policy measures that aim to increase the share of female business owners on a worldwide scale should incorporate the poverty threshold. In terms of regional blocks classifications, varied results are produced for both number of female business owners and number of female sole proprietors.

For this purpose, we assessed authoritarian dispositions in a sample of 100 young adults and collected 3 T MR images. Images were computed using the CAT12 toolbox. Behaviorally, both the LWA and RWA were positively associated with negative urgency; the LWA also showed a robust positive association with trait anxiety. At the neural level, results showed a negative correlation (r = -0.48) between RWA and a GM volume cluster located in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). In addition, we also observed a negative correlation (r = -0.41) between the LWA anti-hierarchical aggression subscale and a CT cluster located in the right anterior insula. Additionally, the resulting clusters converged with further left-wing and right-wing ideology scales related to LWA and RWA, thus providing a robustness check.

I argue that more deliberate discussion of these statistical ‘elephants in the room’ can have a positive impact on improving statistical training and on steering us away from perpetuation of poor research practices. 1) Statistical thinking should come first. This will help us break down some of the stigma around numbers and statistics, and set us up for building analytical frameworks that will provide the most informative answers to our research questions. 2) Descriptive and inferential statistics have different interpretative potential. This will clarify how we can move from using tools that only allow us to talk about our studied samples to using tools that enable us to draw inferences about the underlying populations from which the samples derived. 3) p values can be extremely variable. This will help spread awareness about the misuses and misconceptions of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and demonstrate the dangers of using significance thresholds to interpret data. 4) Statistical precision is not the same as measurement precision. This will bring attention to the many different types of uncertainties that are built into archaeological datasets (e.g., statistical precision, instrument measurement error, natural variation),.Recognising this is key for drawing reliable inferences from our data. 5) Meta-analyses and forest plots can be useful for synthesising previous research. This will help spread awareness about the benefit of meta-analyses for creating evidence-driven summaries of previous findings. The discussion draws on examples from isotope archaeology, bioarchaeology, and organic residue analysis to illustrate how switching from a reliance on significance testing to a reliance on effect sizes can improve methodological rigour and the representativeness of our findings. The paper ends with a discussion of the roles and responsibilities of supervisors for creating an effective learning environment for statistical training. This includes, but is not limited to, acknowledging the problems of NHST and advocating for adherence to Open Science principles. Ultimately, the changes suggested in this paper will help us raise discipline-wide standards for quantitative training and improve both the breadth and the depth of archaeological research.}

While existing evaluation studies primarily focus on unimodal (vision-only) comprehension and reasoning capabilities, they overlook critical assessments of complex multimodal reasoning tasks that require integrated understanding of both visual and textual contexts. Such multimodal tasks present unique challenges, demanding sophisticated reasoning across multiple modalities and deep comprehension of multimodal contexts. In this paper, we present MM-InstructEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that incorporates diverse metrics to assess model performance across various multimodal reasoning tasks with vision-text contexts. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations on 45 models (including 36 MLLMs) across 16 multimodal datasets, encompassing 6 distinct tasks using 10 different instructions. Our framework introduces multiple innovative metrics, including the “Best Performance” metric to benchmark peak model capabilities, the “Mean Relative Gain” metric to assess overall efficacy across models and instructions, the “Stability” metric to measure robustness, and the “Adaptability” metric to quantify the compatibility between models and instructions. Through comprehensive evaluation and analysis, we uncover several significant insights about model architectures, instruction formats, and their interactions in multimodal reasoning tasks. Our findings establish new benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and provide strategic guidance for future developments. To facilitate continued research and evaluation in this field, we release our framework and resources at https://github.com/declare-lab/MM-InstructEval, with an interactive leaderboard available at MM-InstructEval Leaderboard.}

abstract = {This research introduces a robotic grasping system that merges ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detection, VGG19 convolutional neural networks, and RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) geometric verification to achieve high-precision object manipulation in unstructured environments. The framework synergizes ORB's efficient, rotation-invariant keypoints with deep semantic features extracted from intermediate layers of VGG19 enabling robust object recognition under occlusions and lighting variations. ORB detects scale-agnostic keypoints and generates binary descriptors, while VGG19’s hierarchical features provide contextual understanding of object geometry. These complementary features are fused into compact descriptors, combining ORB's 256-bit binary patterns with aggregated VGG19 layer outputs to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. RANSAC is then employed to eliminate mismatched features and estimate precise spatial alignments through iterative homography calculations, ensuring reliable mapping between detected objects and the robot's workspace. Experimental validation on industrial dataset trials demonstrates a 99 % grasp success rate, highlighting the system's ability to address challenges in dynamic, cluttered settings. By bridging deep learning's perceptual capabilities with geometric verification, this work advances autonomous robotic systems, offering a scalable solution for industrial automation that prioritizes precision and adaptability.}

abstract = {Abstract:
Rain gardens play a pivotal role in the infiltration and purification of runoff, with the filler layer being a critical component. However, the selection and configuration of fillers in existing rain gardens often lack scientific rigor, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to systematically evaluate 11 types of fillers, including 5 natural materials, 3 industrial wastes, and 3 artificial materials, aiming to optimize filler configurations and enhance the pollutant removal efficiency of rain gardens. The results demonstrate that steel slag, coconut shell biochar, green zeolite, and fly ash ceramic granules exhibit superior performance in purifying both simulated and actual runoff. The optimal filler combination, comprising 25% green zeolite, 25% steel slag, and 50% coconut shell biochar, achieved removal rates of 50.49%, 76.12%, 44.12%, 89.94%, 58.38%, and 88.19% for COD, NH4+-N, TP, Cu(II), Cr(VI), and tetracycline, respectively. Long-term operational evaluation (>110 days) revealed that the optimized filler layer significantly improved the removal rates of COD, TN, and TP to 86.83%, 80.19%, and 88.42%, respectively. By comparing the physicochemical properties of the fillers before and after use, the mechanisms underlying runoff purification were preliminarily elucidated. Different fillers exhibited specific adsorption capabilities for distinct pollutants, and the synergistic effects of multiple fillers significantly enhanced the rain garden's capacity for source pollutant reduction. AHP was used in this study to validate the scientific validity of AHP in the device of rain gardens through filler combination adsorption experiments and long-term monitoring of rain garden installations, while concurrently offering a broader range of green solutions for the enhancement of rain gardens.}
