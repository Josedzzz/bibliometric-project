abstract = {Biowaste, encompassing food waste and agricultural residues, poses significant environmental challenges while offering transformative opportunities. Traditionally relegated to landfills or incineration, biowaste is increasingly recognized as a renewable resource for producing biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, and animal feed. This review offers a systems-level analysis of biowaste characteristics, conversion processes, and derived bioenergy products such as biofuels, biogas, biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioelectricity, and other valuable chemicals. Diverse conversion methods are explored, including anaerobic digestion, fermentation, microbial fuel cells, pyrolysis, and gasification, alongside conventional practices like landfilling and incineration. Emerging analytical advancements are revolutionizing biowaste valorization. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are highlighted for their transformative impact. For example, AI-driven optimization of pyrolysis conditions has enhanced biochar yield and quality, while predictive modeling using neural networks has improved the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) demonstrates a significant reduction in operational costs through AI-driven process optimization, and life cycle assessment (LCA) quantifies reductions in environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, due to AI-informed process adjustments. Advanced assessment tools, including material flow analysis (MFA), further evaluate resource dynamics within biowaste-to-energy systems. Artificial intelligence and ML optimize waste processing, improving efficiency and product quality. Key analytical tools like TEA, LCA, and MFA assess the financial and environmental viability of these processes.}

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of computer science education, the integration of computational thinking (CT) with artificial intelligence (AI) has become a focus of attention as it may have the potential to technologically facilitate and equip students with required future skills. This research emphasizes the value of the harmonies in between CT and AI within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) structure. Key findings consist of: (a) CT comprises aspects such as abstraction, algorithms, trouble disintegration, pattern recognition, debugging, and AI, which should operate cohesively to deal with complex obstacles properly; (b) Many initiatives have incorporated CT into STEM education and learning via techniques like gamification, high-order thinking questions (HOTS), and peer evaluation. Consequently, it is essential to integrate computational thinking with artificial intelligence in order to improve students' cognitive development and skill acquisition.},

abstract = {An overarching goal of biostatistics education at any public health school is to cultivate students' ability to solve real-world problems. This paper discusses unconventional approaches to enhancing students' problem-solving ability in the setting of an online master degree program in epidemiology. Citing students' actual work, the author advocates shifting more attention to how to foster knowledge elaboration, an integral, yet oft-overlooked part of problem-based learning. The author further illustrates how computational thinking skills can be weaved into biostatistics teaching to facilitate knowledge elaboration.},

abstract = {Computational, logic thinking and problem-solving skills are extremely important for students' success in the future. This poster describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote K-8 Computer Science Education among in-service and pre-service teachers. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to facilitate participants' learning about and application of foundational principles of computer science and computational thinking into K-8 STEM curriculum and teaching. Participants explored hard/software platforms and used open source sites such as Scratch, Code.org and Code Academy. Participants envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms and worked in pairs or groups to design a problem-based project for students. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.},
