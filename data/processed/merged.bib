abstract = {Elementary schools throughout the United States are attempting to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their instruction, often without guidance from research about effective approaches for achieving particular CT goals. This cross-case study investigated the school-wide integration of CT in three elementary schools in a large urban school district in the Northeast that has a district-led CS for All initiative. Data included interviews with teachers, professional development providers, and school administrators as well as surveys from teachers and classroom observations in each participating school. Findings revealed three distinct approaches to integration: (a) single teacher leader-driven model, (b) scaffolded professional development model, and (c) intensive coaching model. These approaches reflect the visions set by administrators and teachers, methods used by professional development providers, and cultures of each school. Across the case studies, common pedagogical approaches included strategic use of both unplugged and plugged activities with a range of computational tools, a focus on collaborative project-based learning, and the use of CT-specific academic language to anchor new CT learning within the academic disciplines. The study highlighted advantages and challenges within each integration approach with implications for schools considering CT integration.},

abstract = {In today's increasingly digital world, it is critical that all students learn to think computationally from an early age. Assessments of Computational Thinking (CT) are essential for capturing information about student learning and challenges. Several existing K-12 CT assessments focus on concepts like variables, iterations and conditionals without emphasizing practices like algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and debugging. In this paper, we discuss the development of and results from a validated CT Practices assessment for 4th-6th grade students. The assessment tasks are multilingual, shifting the focus to CT practices, and making the assessment useful for students using different CS curricula and different programming languages. Results from an implementation of the assessment with about 15000 upper elementary students in Hong Kong indicate challenges with algorithm comparison given constraints, deciding when code can be reused, and choosing debugging test cases. These results point to the utility of our assessment as a curricular tool and the need for emphasizing CT practices in future curricular initiatives and teacher professional development.},

abstract = {The Use-Modify-Create progression (UMC) was conceptualized in 2011 after comparing the productive integration of computational thinking across National Science Foundation-funded Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (NSF ITEST) programs. Since that time, UMC has been widely promoted as a means to scaffold student learning of computational thinking (CT) while enabling personalization and allowing for creative adaptations of pre-existing computational artifacts. In addition to UMC's continued application, it has recently been utilized to scaffold student learning in topics as diverse as machine learning, e-textiles, and computer programming. UMC has also been applied to instructional goals other than "supporting students in becoming creators of computational artifacts." This panel will re-examine the UMC progression and refine our understanding of when its use is suitable, and when not, and share findings on evaluations and extensions to UMC that are productive in new and different contexts.},

The activity was applied to a reinforcement class of the K-8, in a public school in Birigui, S\~{a}o Paulo, Brazil. The activity used the Balance of Equations game, built on the Scratch programming environment with the objective of teaching the initial ideas of first degree equations to a class with a learning gap in this discipline. The planning of the activity was divided into three moments, with the intention of starting from an analogy to the principle of equivalence of an equation, reaching the algebraic transcription of an equation through activities of manipulation of the game code. Seven concepts related to computational thinking with strong potential to be worked during the activity were identified. In this way, besides the presentation of the classroom case, this article identifies these seven concepts, analyzing how they could be developed during the application of the activity, seeking to answer the following question: How can computational thinking skills be explored through hands-on activity for the teaching of equations?},

College teachers in China took less systematic training in order to adequately prepare them for increasingly higher teaching requirements. To address this issue, this paper first proposes an outcomes-based teacher education program distinguished from CT principles under teaching and learning perspective, decomposed an abstract computational thinking idea into a definite coursework content. This paper then describe an outcomes-based evaluative frame which supports teachers to ensure a successful application of CT theories and concepts into practical skill development.

This study analyzes students' collaborative learning experiences within small interdisciplinary "cohorts" while learning computational thinking in a university-level class. The cohort allows students from different disciplines to contribute diverse perspectives, socially interact with each other and in turn create situations where two or more students learn together. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative means to explore students' collaborative learning experiences. Ethnographically-informed qualitative data using Stahl's collaborative framework is analyzed. The analysis revealed that most students found the cohort model to be valuable in learning computational thinking by allowing them to ask about and explain problems, especially with students from different disciplines who perceive and explain a problem differently. Quantitative data from a multi-term survey complements and confirms the findings from the qualitative data. Our study helps to inform those teaching foundational computing concepts to a diverse audience of learners.},

Robotics programs can be engaging learning environments for acquiring core computational thinking competencies. However, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a robotics programming curriculum for developing computational thinking knowledge and skills. This study measures pre/post gains with new computational thinking assessments given to middle school students who participated in a virtual robotics programming curriculum. Overall, participation in the virtual robotics curriculum was related to significant gains in pre- to posttest scores, with larger gains for students who made further progress through the curriculum. The success of this intervention suggests that participation in a scaffolded programming curriculum, within the context of virtual robotics, supports the development of generalizable computational thinking knowledge and skills that are associated with increased problem-solving performance on nonrobotics computing tasks. Furthermore, the particular units that students engage in may determine their level of growth in these competencies.},

abstract = {In recent years, Computational Thinking (CT) made its way into K-12 as a key set of 21st-century skills. However, the issue of assessing student's learning of CT remains a challenging one: it is indeed not clear how to achieve a comprehensive evaluation that is able to assess not only the technical and domain-specific skills, but also the domain-independent meta-skills of CT. Finding a solution to this issue is crucial, because assessment not only determines whether or not educational goals are being met, but also supports the design of a curriculum. Multiple forms of assessments have been proposed within the main perspective of programming skills, neglecting the possible generalization of CT training on other skills. In this work, we first review the existing approaches to CT assessment. Then, we discuss what non-technical skills (relational skills and cognitive life-skills) should be included in a comprehensive CT assessment framework. Moreover, we provide an indication of possible solutions to capitalize on the existing experiences in order to achieve a feasible integration of different types of assessment.},

abstract = {In Latin America, computational thinking workshops are mostly developed in urban areas, charging participation fees. And although teachers are increasingly being expected to include technology in their classrooms, computational thinking and programming are not mandatory topics in teacher training programs. This hinders the development of digital skills among Latino students, and we expect that the digital gap between urban and rural populations will expand over time, especially in socio-economically vulnerable populations. Believing that teachers can be agents of change, we designed a 12 hour workshop to train the K-8 teaching staff in a rural and vulnerable school. The goal of this experience was to help these teachers develop basic computational thinking skills and devise new ways to incorporate what they learned in their classrooms. In this paper, we report our experience facilitating this workshop, and analyze the teacher perceptions before and after the intervention. Teacher attitudes changed drastically during the execution of the workshop, and they were able to come up with creative ways of incorporating computational thinking activities into their subjects. The reported experience can be used as input to develop public policies with respect to how computational thinking should be introduced in rural and vulnerable environments.},

abstract = {With national K-12 education initiatives such as "CSForAll," block-based programming environments have emerged as widely used tools for teaching novice programming. A key challenge presented by block-based programming environments is assessing students' computational thinking (CT) and programming competencies. Developing assessment methods that can evaluate students' use of CT practices such as testing and refining, and developing and using appropriate algorithms, can help teachers evaluate students learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. In this work, we utilize an evidence-centered assessment design approach to devise a three-dimensional assessment to evaluate students' CT competencies based on evidence extracted from their programming trajectories in a block-based programming environment. In this assessment, the first dimension assesses students' knowledge of essential CT concepts, the second dimension assesses students' dynamic testing and refining strategies, and the third dimension assesses their overall problem-solving efficiency. We apply the assessment framework to data collected from students' interactions with a game-based learning environment designed to develop middle-grade students' CT competencies and programming skills. The results demonstrate that students' knowledge of basic CT constructs, such as appropriate use and combination of control structures, serves as the foundation for designing and implementing effective algorithms. Further, we assessed students testing and refining strategies over the three dimensions of novelty, positivity, and scale. The results demonstrate that students with higher algorithmic capabilities tend to make more novel, positive, and small-scale changes. The results reveal distinctive patterns in students' approaches to computational thinking problem solving and make a step toward identifying and assessing productive computational thinking practices.},

Despite the undisputed importance of assessment, the fact is that there is not enough evidence on which abilities are merely theoretical and which can be empirically observed in the context of CT. This paper is part of a larger investigation in which we try to answer a simple question: can CT abilities be quantitatively defined and measured? In this particular study, we try to answer a simple question: How many CT abilities can be empirically observed using factor analysis? We approach this question, using a dataset containing answers of 1564 students from Lithuania in the Bebras Challenge from 2015. Firstly, we used confirmatory factor analysis to verify a theory that claims that five CT abilities are assessed by the contest. Our analysis shows the theory is not statistically supported. Secondly, we used principal component analysis as an exploratory analysis to try to derive an appropriate number of factors from the data. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests there are only two main recognizable factors. Finally, we briefly discuss these factors and hypothesize that the first is called evaluation ability, which would include abstraction, generalization, and decomposition, while factor 2 is algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning.},

This paper analyses the success of this training scheme and uses the results of the study to focus on the skills of computational thinking, and to explore how math teachers expect to integrate computing into the K-12 math syllabus. The coursework and feedback from the MOOC course indicate that they readily associate computational thinking with problem solving in math. In addition, some of the teachers are inspired by the new opportunities to be creative in their teaching. However, the set of programming concepts they refer to in their essays is insubstantial and unfocused, so these concepts are consolidated here to form a hypothetical learning trajectory for computational thinking.},

RoboSTEAM project deals with this issue by the application of a Challenge Based Learning approach that uses Robotics and Physical Devices. One of the problems found during the project is the complexity of the application of a Challenge Based Learning approach due to the special needs of each educational institution. Given this situation the present work presents provides a flexible definition of challenge and describes also samples regarding how to use them.},

abstract = {Introducing coding in the curriculum at an early age is considered a long term investment in bridging the skills gap between the technology demands of the labour market and the availability of people to fill them. The keys to success include moving from mere literacy to active control - not only at the level of learners but also at the level of teachers. However, given the fast development of the field, one might wonder whether acquiring specific coding skills really is the essence of introducing coding early in the curriculum. We argue that the reach of ICT -including coding skills- is much broader than STEM alone and a background in STEM is no longer a requirement for successful coding. The complex link between coding and computational thinking is the real critical success factor. We refer to TACCLE3 (an EU Erasmus+ project) as a successful approach to the implementation and valorisation of computational thinking across the curriculum.},

The paper introduces also a teaching model based on narrative learning where the screenplay of the game has a key role. A preliminary analysis of the project results highlights how children's perception of computer programming is influenced by practical coding sessions; furthermore, these results suggest that some individual features (e.g. gender; math and language competencies), and the socio-economics familiar context can significantly impact on development of computational thinking skills.},

Keeko robot can carry out voice interaction, screen interaction, programming board interaction, and help children learn to code. This paper conducted semi-structured interviews and observed the demonstration courses with Keeko robot development team, designed the questionnaire based on the theoretical foundation of Positive Technological Development)PTD(, carried out an online survey on 103 preschool teachers who had used Keeko as a teaching tool of computational thinking, and a total of 89 participants completed the questionnaire. Single-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistics was used to analyze the questionnaire data, and obtain preliminary views on using Keeko robot to motivate children's positive behaviors. The results showed that the median of the six constructs in the questionnaire is greater than 4 (4 represents uncertain attitude and neutral attitude), which meant that they have a positive attitude towards using Keeko robot to carry out the computational thinking education. The research result helps people understand the attitude of preschool teachers and provides a valuable reference for the development and design of related robots in the future. In the meanwhile, it also helps preschool teachers to improve their understanding of robots, curriculum content, teaching process and children's behavior, so as to effectively carry out the computational thinking education on preschoolers.},

To address this issue, our design team developed a music-based puzzle game called SynthSync. The game challenges players to work collaboratively to "debug" jumbled musical compositions through close listening, tinkering, and communication. SynthSync players manipulate controls to adjust musical variables (pitch, note length, and the length of rests) in arhythmic and dissonant musical puzzles based on popular songs until they "discover" the original piece of music.},

abstract = {Recently, Computer Science education in Switzerland reached a critical milestone. In the past two years the School of Education of FHNW, one of Switzerland's largest schools of education, introduced a mandatory Computer Science education module, comprised of a two-course sequence for its students: pre-service primary-level schoolteachers. Due to its design and audience, this mandatory module introduces a variety of unique challenges. The module is taken by a majority of female students (75\%), many with no prior experience and/or interest in programming and Computer Science. The module starts with a course focused on learning Computational Thinking, referred to as FW, followed by a course focused on teaching Computational Thinking, referred to as FD. Since 2017, 1000 pre-service primary-level teachers have been trained in Computer Science education through this module. This curricula initiative computes the effect sizes from teaching two complete iterations of the "FW then FD" design. It is based on attitude assessment data collected at four points: Pre-FW, Post-FW, Pre-FD, Post-FD, during the first two years of this mandatory module. Our research indicates that, by course's end, pre-service teachers are mostly confident in their ability to program and think computationally.},

abstract = {This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in Ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better "logical thinking") is applicable not only to STEM subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited to decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called "moral machines", using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behaviours under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will have to deal also with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as part of de difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a "right" versus "wrong" answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

Coding games and problem solving exercises have been growing in popularity. Many large-scale initiatives have been launched in order to bring these initiatives into classrooms, from preschool to secondary education. CodyColor is a simplified coding game, which takes basic programming instructions representing movements ("turn left" and "turn right") and represents them with color blocks. In contrast to most other coding games, color-coded programming relies on no symbolic interpretation on part of the player in order to be approachable by very young players as well. We present a massively multiplayer online version of CodyColor, discuss design and implementation specifics, and enumerate some of the possible game modes.},

A systematic literature review methodology was adopted in this study. Out of 161 articles retrieved, 33 of them that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Our study revealed that the use of CT at HEIs for programming education began in 2010; many studies did not specify the context of use, but the use of CT is found to be gaining grounds in many contexts, especially the developed countries; course design approach was mostly employed by educators to introduce CT at HEIs for programming education. Furthermore, this study pointed out how CT approach can be explored for designing a smart learning environment to support students in learning computer programming.},

Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of computational thinking in the elementary computer courses. Through such an evaluation, we can obtain the objective data which reflects the teaching effect of elementary computer courses, establish scientific teaching evaluation matrices, and emphasize the importance of those courses. In this paper, we investigate the teaching effectiveness for achieve accurate data and decision support on the computational-thinking-oriented computer curriculum reform. Our research is based on recent evaluations and data acquisition. We analyze the test database, categories of questions, and scores of students. We find several problems, such as the over-emphasizing the programming, incomplete knowledge components, limited background, large deviation of evaluation results among universities. Finally, we give several improvement recommendations.},

abstract = {Computational thinking complements critical thinking as a way of reasoning to solve problems, make decisions and interact with our world. It draws concepts and techniques such as abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, evaluation and iteration from computer and information science, but has broad application in the arts, sciences, humanities and social sciences. This paper compares computational and critical modes of thinking, identifying concepts and terminology that support cross-disciplinary discourse, inform faculty and curriculum development efforts, and interconnect learning outcomes at the course, program and university level, thus helping programs better articulate contributions to institutional goals. A better understanding of each mode can enrich what we teach aspiring information professionals about computational and critical thinking, how we teach it, and how we apply these skills in our professional work.},

We will use the sensor technologies to conduct a variety of short, real-world investigations, such as measuring air quality and noise levels using the available sensors. Teachers will largely play the role of students as they learn to program the sensor technologies, gather and analyze data, and create displays to share their findings. The workshop will use an open-access, one-week sensor immersion curriculum, and ideas for improvements will be solicited from by the group. No prior experience using sensor technologies or programming is needed.},

abstract = {Even though the computer science education community has not definitively established exactly what ?Computational Thinking" entails, most will agree that it is using a computing machine to solve problems. Like all tools for solving problems, this knowledge should be made available to everyone. Jeannette Wing sounded this call in 2006, writing that "computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone." These skills are not just for computer scientists, but for anyone and everyone who plans to solve problems. We already teach other forms of problem solving to all our students including: Mathematical Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning. Computational Thinking, as well as engineering and design's Design Thinking, should be equally exposed to all students. It is also important to illuminate that these tools are not used in isolation to solve problems. Perhaps the key to the acceptance of Computational Thinking (as well as Design Thinking) as essential educational tools is to highlight their overlap and interdependence with other problem solving skills. The next generation will need practice with every tool at their disposal to be prepared to solve tomorrow's problems. I propose embedding Computational Thinking in a problem solving framework that leverages teachers' (and students') existing knowledge of problem solving in mathematics, science, and language arts in order to encourage teachers in non CS disciplines to teach Computational Thinking in their classrooms.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to the contemporary debate on the increasing use of computational thinking (CT) in primary schools. It is based on an empirical study in which 28 Swedish third-grade school children (9-10 years of age) participated in a creative workshop where they were challenged to design a digital game using stop-motion film technique, working in groups. The study applies a designerly approach to game design activities to investigate what aspects of computational skills can be identified when children employ stop motion filmmaking as a means to envision a digital game design idea and how a designerly approach can enable them to enact dimensions of their computational skills? The data included video observations, casual conversations, and stop-motion videos representing the children's game design ideas. The analysis identified three aspects of computational thinking strategies while children produced stop-motion films: step-by-step procedural skills; design and arrangement skills; and computational perspectives.},

abstract = {As educational jurisdictions around the world begin to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their K-12 mandatory curriculum, there is a need to ensure that classroom activities are engaging, relate to student interests, and effectively promote the development of CT skills. The analysis of sports performance data fulfills this criteria for some students and teachers and presents an exciting context in which students from all K-12 grades can access complex CT concepts. This lightning talk investigates sports analytic tasks within the context of the CT in mathematics and science taxonomy introduced by Weintrop et al. (2015). Specific classroom activities are presented including analyzing the distribution of soccer goals, baseball salaries, the location of successful basketball shots, and the placement of volleyball serves. Examples of data analytics projects will be shared and the four main components of the taxonomy (data practices, modelling and simulation practices, computational problem-solving practices and systems thinking practices) will be identified within each project.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how a few changes in some computational thinking tasks proposed during the Bebras challenge affected the solvers' performance. After the 2016 challenge held in November in our country (Italy), we interviewed some participants on the difficulties they had faced and we modified some of the tasks accordingly. We then proposed the whole set of tasks, with some of them modified, to pupils who had not participated to the challenge in November and compared performances in the two sessions. Using Item Response Theory, we measured the change in the distribution of difficulty and discrimination of the modified tasks. On the basis of the obtained results, we tried to better understand the many factors which influenced the difference in performances, both in the conceptual and cognitive task content and in its presentation (text, images, layout).},

In this report, we examine the affordances of using a sensor platform to support the integration of disciplinary learning and computational thinking (CT) aligned with Next Generation Science Standards and the CT in STEM Taxonomy developed by Weintrop and colleagues. In the first unit, students investigated the conditions for mold growth within their school using a custom sensor system. After analyzing implementation experiences and student interest data, our team engaged in another round of co-design to develop a second instructional unit. This unit uses a different sensor system (the micro:bit) which supports additional CT in STEM practices due to its block-based programming interface and its real time data display. For the second unit we selected a different phenomenon: understanding and designing maglev trains.},

abstract = {This study intends to investigate the present situation of AI curriculum offered for grades K-12. We screened 11 representative countries and areas from six continents and assessed the content of their top K-12 AI courses in terms of teaching content and teaching implementation in order to comprehend the current state of K-12 AI courses in diverse nations. Provide some ideas and suggestions for the development of AI courses for students in grades K-12. (1) Countries may choose AI applications, AI influences in various aspects, AI ethics, machine learning, data, classification, reasoning, Identify, and other content to establish independent AI teaching content standards; or choose programming as the core teaching content/starting point; or integrate programming, data, AI, and other content related to improving students' computational thinking into computer/science/technology courses. (2) Project-based learning is still the primary way of instruction, along with a range of other approaches. There are four categories of available instructional resources, and there is an abundance of them. Most countries emphasize the evaluation of students' abilities and the results achieved in the learning process.},

abstract = {Curriculum development is dependent on the following question: What are the learning goals for a specific topic, and what are reasonable ways to organize and order those goals? Learning trajectories (LTs) for computational thinking (CT) topics will help to guide emerging curriculum development efforts for computer science in elementary school. This study describes the development of an LT for Debugging. We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K-8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning. The concepts were organized into the LT presented within. In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful. Finally, we illustrate how the Debugging LT has guided our efforts to develop an integrated mathematics and CT curriculum for grades 3-5.},

abstract = {Data science is an emerging 21st century literacy that promises to support learning in a wide variety of disciplines, from science, to social science, to the humanities. It also provides an engaging context in which to learn computational thinking skills in existing classroom contexts. For my dissertation research, I will explore whether and how data science can support inquiry-based learning in social studies. I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computational thinking to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.},

abstract = {Many K-12 educators who are new to computer science (CS) may have a lack of confidence or sense of intimidation when starting their CS teaching journey. To mitigate this, Massachusetts DESE contracted CSforMA to create a three-day "Introduction to Computer Science for Educators" workshop (ICSW) focused on CS fundamentals. The ICSW covered grade-level CS terminology and concepts including computational thinking, physical computing, and programming. Evaluation of the ICSW showed 98\% of respondents reported increased knowledge of CS. In a survey administered later that summer, 100\% of respondents who took the ICSW reported that it helped them better understand curriculum materials. This replicable, scalable, and successful ICSW model could benefit other State DoEs and CS professional development coordinators. This work also shows the benefits of using an external evaluator.},

abstract = {Introducing digital literacy to young children develops foundational skills in problem-solving and supports their cognitive development, including critical thinking. However, physical manipulatives for digital literacy are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young children. Physical manipulatives can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational digital literacy through dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised coding activities. This paper presents an initial study in a preschool environment with children (ages 3 – 5 years) using novel physical manipulatives, Embeddables (Fig. 1), in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool. From our initial analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identify how, firstly, children used the proximal relations to undertake experimental understanding of the devices, which secondly led to using the proximal relationships in their social play, further supported by the scale and feedback of the toys.},

Computer science courses and academic pathways are not always offered in secondary schools. Many teachers are not trained in computer science, yet are pushed to incorporate more computing, computational thinking, and computer usage. A qualitative focus group study was implemented to assess the computer science identities of African American teachers and of their respective urban secondary schools serving African American students. Three major codes were identified: district administration of computer and computing implementation, teacher attitudes towards computer science instruction, and teachers' recommendations to improve computer science and computational thinking instruction and outreach for African American secondary school students. Findings can be used to improve computer science and technology rollout programs from county and district administrations, teacher instruction with digital tools, and computer science outreach for African American secondary school students.},

Course modifications were made to augment CS1 with support inside and outside of the classroom for students to be successful. The use of in class tutors and requiring design documents were two of the primary modifications made to the course. A variety of data was collected in areas such as student planning, program design, frustration, and resources used to determine what relationships impact student success.

abstract = {Computer Science competencies are becoming increasingly important in our current digitised society. To foster students in Computer Science, different countries have introduced subjects with new educational plans based on Computer Science frameworks, such as the K-12 CS Framework and the Informatics Reference Framework for Schools. Those include, in one way or another, four content areas: data and coding (including data structures and their applications), algorithms (involving variables, loops, and software projects), computers and networks (emphasizing the role of computers in a network and data transmission) and information society and data security (covering topics like asymmetric encryption and personal data protection). Various tests have been developed in the field of Computer Science Education for different age groups, primarily at university level for introductory Computer Science courses, and some for upper secondary school level and below, particularly for Computational Thinking. Given the research context, the objective of this study is to develop a set of items that measures the content knowledge in the four aforementioned areas. Specifically, the study focuses on the educational plan of the Computer Science subject called IMP, which is taught from the 8th to the 10th grade in secondary schools in Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany. In total, 155 items were evaluated by experts, resulting in a test consisting of 68 items. This poster abstract presents the ongoing progress of the test development.},

CCEs address core aspects of computational thinking while exposing students to creative thinking skills, and can be adapted for use in your own courses. Activities such as writing a story in separate chapters and then merging the chapters to form a coherent whole, creating quilt-like patterns with written descriptions, or designing testing strategies for an alien health machine require students to apply computational thinking to unorthodox contexts and situations promoting creative application of CS knowledge and skills. CCEs are group-based, promote active learning, and are designed to foster collaborative problem solving necessary in today's workplace. They require no programming experience making them accessible to students including those with limited CS background and those with interests in non-CS disciplines, which can encourage more diverse participation in computing. Engage in a hands-on demo of a CCE and learn how to adapt CCEs for use in your classes, including technical support from the IC2Think Project team. Learn about the rigorous research studies behind the development, design and administration of these CCEs, including the instruments we used to evaluate the CCEs. Workshop session will include "how-to" presentations, panel-based Q&amp;A, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. Let's compute, create, and collaborate!},

abstract = {Student success in introductory computing course continues to be a major challenge. Though there has been much research and innovation in recent years to help reduce high failure rates, a substantial population of students still struggle in a typical CS1 course. In this paper we create an argument of validity of the Placement Skills Inventory (PSIv1). The goal of the PSIv1 is to help advise and place students into an appropriate introductory computing course. While placement exams have been developed in the past, the goal of PSIv1 is to differentiate students who will be successful in a CS1 course and those that would be better served taking a CS0 course as their first computing course. In contrast, traditional placement exams have focused on differentiating students between CS1 and CS2. The PSIv1 is a combination of two instruments, the Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test and the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised Version 2. These two instruments measure students' computation thinking skills and prior programming knowledge respectively. The PSIv1 was administered to all students enrolled in either a CS0 or CS1 during the first two weeks of the semester. We use Item Response Theory to create an argument of validity of the PSIv1 and look at differences in scores on the PSIv1 based on if a student passed or failed a CS0 and CS1 course. We then used the results to create an advising strategy and criteria to help students decided if they should enroll in a CS0 or CS1 course.},

The pre-test and post-test learning outcomes were validate by t-test and one-way ANOVA. This experiment aimed to understand the learning outcomes after adopting grouping strategies, as well as the learning outcomes of students with different backgrounds after adopting grouping strategies.The results showed that both student-selected grouping and heterogeneous grouping can improve the learning outcome. The learning outcome with student-selected grouping is business management background &gt; other backgrounds &gt; design background &gt; electrical engineering and computer science background. With heterogeneous grouping, the learning outcome of the design background is close to that of the electrical engineering and computer science background, and there is no significant difference among electrical engineering and computer science, business management, and other learning backgrounds. Thus, the learning outcome with heterogeneous grouping is better than that with student-selected grouping.},

abstract = {In 1962, Thomas Kuhn changed our understanding of scientific progress through his explanation of scientific paradigms and attribution of scientific advances to paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn, a discipline's paradigm drives research, provides explanations, and directs the accumulation of discipline-specific knowledge. In 2006 and 2008 Jeanette Wing authored articles that reignited interest in computational thinking (CT) education and CT education research. Wing's articles, arguably, set in place the conceptual foundations of the paradigm currently guiding CT education and paved the way for a fruitful decade of CT education research. We are concerned, however, that the present direction of CT education and research will not support CT as an integral part of K-12 education. In its current form, CT instruction focuses almost exclusively on teaching students to program and isolates CT from disciplinary content; perpetuating the persistent misconception that programming = CT. This approach to CT education may deprive students of the opportunity to adequately develop foundational CT skills (e.g. systems thinking, abstraction and generalization, data collection and utilization, solution evaluation) and may prevent teachers from persistently and meaningfully integrating CT into their curriculum. Through this talk, we identify features of the current CT paradigm, question their alignment with Wing's ideal of "computational thinking for everyone," and propose specific recommendations for expanding the current CT paradigm.},

abstract = {Data for Healthy Communities (DHC) is a 15-hour high school project that uses spreadsheets and public data to provide an accessible introduction to data science in the broader context of decision making for complex societal problems. Students work with real-world government data in the context of public health and will learn how to use data as evidence to support an argument for investment in their local communities. The no-code interface of spreadsheet software allows students to explore basic computing concepts such as variables and functions while engaging with authentic public health challenges like air quality, health inequity, and environmental burden. The intention is to lower the barrier for students' first introduction to computing and to present options for embedding data science education in a wider variety of curricular areas.The project is scaffolded by skill-building modules that use a mix of lectures, class demonstrations, and labs to guide students through exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data to make an argument. Students then apply these skills in a team-based activity that challenges them to use real neighborhood-level community indicators to create a structured presentation to a city council to advocate for community investment. After the student presentations, it is recommended to hold a class discussion to highlight the complexity of real-world problems where there is no one right answer. Rather, complex problems often require teams to consider several factors to build an argument for a proposed solution.},

However, as these subjects are still relatively new to pre-tertiary education there is much investigation to be done into how best to present these topics and how to prepare teachers. In this study we focus on the presentation of topics relating to computing, Computational Thinking, and Computer Science for primary schools.We analyse English-language curricula that have been published, specifically the English, Australian and CSTA curricula for primary schools. From this we establish the main topics covered, and how they are positioned to be suitable for students from the first year of school to approximately their eighth year.We then report on a pilot study of a curriculum based on Computational Thinking; long term the study will encompass a range of topics and year levels, but the pilot focused on topics suitable for 11 to 12 year old students. Here we detail the design of this part of the curriculum, the manner of its delivery, and the experiences and observations of the generalist teacher who taught the course. Through assessment data, student responses to an attitude survey, and class observations we have evaluated the pilot curriculum. The findings of this study are being used to inform the design of a planned larger scale study.},

abstract = {While most teachers welcome the idea of learning activities fostering creativity, it is not clear how to effectively scaffold creativity. Without suitable pedagogical approaches, it is difficult to provide appropriate levels of scaffolding. Over-scaffolding, on the one hand, while providing support appreciated especially by less experienced students, leaves little room for creative expression. Under-scaffolding, on the other hand, while fostering more authentic learning opportunities with a high potential for creativity, can lead to student frustration. The Process Artifact Creativity Landscape (PACL) is a framework that helps pre-service teachers scaffold creative projects. PACL consists of a two dimensional space providing four scaffolding approaches offering different tradeoffs between scaffolding and creativity. This paper introduces the PACL framework and outlines experiences with K–6 preservice teachers reasoning about scaffold creative programming projects.},

Though an attractive potential solution to integrating language arts skills across topic areas such as computational thinking and science, better understanding of how to structure and support these activities is needed to increase adoption by teachers. Building on prior research on block-based programming for interactive storytelling, we present initial results from a study of 28 narrative programs created by upper elementary students that were collected in both classroom and extracurricular contexts. The narrative programs are evaluated across multiple dimensions to better understand the types of narrative programs being created by the students, characteristics of the students who created the narratives, and what types of support could most benefit the students in their narrative program construction. In addition to analyzing the student-created narrative programs, we also provide recommendations for promising system-generated and instructor-led supports.},

abstract = {Programming courses can be challenging for first year university students, especially for those without prior coding experience. Students initially struggle with code syntax, but as more advanced topics are introduced across a semester, the difficulty in learning to program shifts to learning computational thinking (e.g., debugging strategies). This study examined the relationships between students' rate of programming errors and their grades on two exams. Using an online integrated development environment, data were collected from 280 students in a Java programming course. The course had two parts. The first focused on introductory procedural programming and culminated with exam 1, while the second part covered more complex topics and object-oriented programming and ended with exam 2. To measure students' programming abilities, 51095 code snapshots were collected from students while they completed assignments that were autograded based on unit tests. Compiler and runtime errors were extracted from the snapshots, and three measures - Error Count, Error Quotient and Repeated Error Density - were explored to identify the best measure explaining variability in exam grades. Models utilizing Error Quotient outperformed the models using the other two measures, in terms of the explained variability in grades and Bayesian Information Criterion. Compiler errors were significant predictors of exam 1 grades but not exam 2 grades; only runtime errors significantly predicted exam 2 grades. The findings indicate that leveraging Error Quotient with multiple error types (compiler and runtime) may be a better measure of students' introductory programming abilities, though still not explaining most of the observed variability.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77\% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46\% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80\% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

While learning computational skills and designing interactive paper quilts, high school students of color will draw upon their lived experiences to reimagine new connections and stories about CS. Using video observations and field notes, students' reflective worksheets and artifacts, and student interviews, I will explore what happens when youth of color use CS skills and digital technologies to "restory" their CS identities, the kinds of metanarratives about CS and computer scientists youth identify, and what the process of restorying looks like in practice.},

abstract = {Algebraic laws of functions in mathematics – such as commutativity, associativity, and idempotence – are often used as the basis to derive more sophisticated properties of complex mathematical structures and are heavily used in abstract computational thinking. Algebraic laws of functions in coding, however, are rarely considered. Yet, they are essential. For example, commutativity and associativity are crucial to ensure correctness of a variety of software systems in numerous domains, such as compiler optimization, big data processing, data flow processing, machine learning or distributed algorithms and data structures. Still, most programming languages lack built-in mechanisms to enforce and verify that operations adhere to such properties. In this paper, we propose a verifier specialized on a set of fundamental algebraic laws that ensures that such laws hold in application code. The verifier can conjecture auxiliary properties and can reason about both equalities and inequalities of expressions, which is crucial to prove a given property when other competitors do not succeed. We implement these ideas in the Propel verifier. Our evaluation against five state-of-the-art verifiers on a total of 142 instances of algebraic properties shows that Propel is able to automatically deduce algebraic properties in different domains that rely on such properties for correctness, even in cases where competitors fail to verify the same properties or time out.},

However, today's games perpetuate an arguably obsolete relationship between programmable agents and human operators. Borrowing from the field of human-robotics interaction, we argue that collaborative robots, or cobots, are a better model for thinking about computational agents, working directly with humans rather than in place of or at arm's length from them. In this paper, we describe an initial design inquiry into the design of “cobot games”, programmable agent scenarios in which players program an in-game ally to assist them in accomplishing gameplay objectives. We detail three questions that emerged out of this exploration, our present thinking on them, and plans for deepening inquiry into cobot game design moving forward.},

abstract = {A research-practice partnership (RPP) used a teacher co-design process, supported by equity-focused professional development, to create an elementary-level curriculum that integrates content, practices, and learning progressions from state computing standards with other standards-based curricula. Most district students are part of historically marginalized groups and the RPP chose to develop an equity and inclusion-focused curriculum that would be taught in all elementary classrooms to all students. Twelve teacher teams, supported by researchers and ELL and SPED specialists, designed, piloted, and documented 23 modules of 4-8, 45-minute lessons across K-5. Early adopter teachers followed the pilots and implemented the modules in their classrooms with the goal of facilitating adoption by all elementary classroom teachers. After being interrupted by the pandemic, the RPP developed a strategy where principals in cohorts of schools agreed to collaborate with RPP school-based lead teachers to establish professional learning communities (PLCs) to support classroom implementation of the modules. Eleven schools participated in a 2021-22 cohort and nine more schools joined in 2022-23. Centering equity, PLCs, and quality module documentation and materials are key to sustaining and evolving the CSforAll curriculum. The modules were revised based on feedback obtained from ELL and SPED specialists, early adopters, teacher coordinators, researchers, and district curriculum directors. Using a large data set of meeting and classroom observation records, interviews, field notes, focus groups, surveys, and module documentation, we track the evolution of the curriculum and provide a detailed analysis of one module as an example.},

abstract = {Integrated computing uses computing tools and concepts to support learning in other disciplines while giving all students opportunities to experience computer science. Integrated computing is often motivated as a way to introduce computing to students in a low-stakes environment, reducing barriers to learning computer science, often especially for underrepresented groups. This study explored integrated computing activities implemented in US schools to examine which programming and CT concepts they teach and whether those concepts differed across contexts. We gathered data on 262 integrated computing activities from in-service K-12 teachers and 20 contextual factors related to the classroom, the teacher, and the school. Our analysis revealed that programming and CT concepts were inversely related to five contextual factors, such that factors predicting more CT concepts also predicted fewer programming concepts. These factors reflected school resources, such that wealthier schools used activities with more CT concepts and fewer programming concepts. In addition, factors related to underrepresented groups often related to fewer concepts being taught in activities. School racial composition was the only factor of the 20 that had a relationship with both types of concepts in the same direction-students from underrepresented groups used activities with fewer CT and programming concepts. Our findings suggest that, although integrated computing can potentially introduce computing to a broader audience, we must evaluate what these activities are teaching and to whom. Another primary contribution of this work is an open-access dataset about integrated computing activities, the concepts that they teach, and the contextual factors around their use.},

abstract = {The common approach for introducing middle school and high school students to computational thinking and engineering is through programming or robotics activities that were designed without much social context. Therefore, one of the challenges such outreach programs pose is further stereotyping of students who are interested in computer science, by presenting them as people who ought to be hyper-intelligent and very much focused on computers with no social skills. Realizing the above, and wanting to attract a diverse audience to study computer science, we developed a one-day workshop which showcases the interdisciplinary nature of computer science and the various ways computing can help students discover and solve societal problems. We chose multiculturalism, cyber security and air pollution as the context of our computational thinking activities. This paper describes our experiences in developing and teaching the workshops that runs three to five times a year, hosted either in our institute or at local schools. Regardless of students' previous STEM experiences and socioeconomic statuses, both students and teachers reported that the knowledge gained enabled them to either create a computer program or a robot and also led to a better understanding of how computers can be used in daily life. In other words, the workshop successfully opened the minds and perspectives of the middle school and high school students on computer science. Additionally, over time, we also observed an increased number of students and schools participating in such workshops.},

Our design-based, collaborative learning environment aims to provide students in K-12 classrooms with immersive experiences in CT through computational modeling in realistic scenarios (e.g., building models of scientific phenomena). The goal is to increase student engagement and include inclusive opportunities for developing key computational skills needed for the 21st century workforce. Research implementations that include a semester-long high school physics classroom study have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in supporting synergistic learning of STEM and CS/CT concepts and practices, especially when compared to a traditional classroom approach. This technology demonstration will showcase our CS+X (X = physics, marine biology, or earth science) learning environment and associated curricula. Participants can engage in our design process and learn how to develop curricular modules that cover STEM and CS/CT concepts and practices.

Our results highlight the potential of this fine-grained data capture. Snapshot frequencies in trajectories collected before and after a coding intervention showcase the collective progress of the learners. Graph visualizations, in which nodes represent snapshots and directed edges code edits, highlight strategies, pitfalls and debugging procedures. Individual programming trajectories shed light on details of learners' problem-solving processes that less granular analysis would conceal. Various works in the field of Learning Analytics research show the usefulness of collecting fine-grained process data that proceed from programming activities. However, how to analyze this data is still an open question and research on the subject is in an experimental phase.

The project is aimed at improving the attitudes and computational thinking skills for African American elementary school children in the 3rd to 5th grades and to understand their difficulties in reasoning about code. This was done within the context of a five-week summer camp. There were 40 children of whom about half were females. Along with instruction, we used a custom video game to teach code tracing. We used video game data and pre and posttests to assess students' performance. Qualitative and quantitative results from our mixed method design show cognitive and affective improvements as well as improvements in computational thinking skills. The data we collected also highlighted potential common mistakes that elementary school children might make as they attempt to reason about code. It shows the potential in games to motivate code understanding practice and improve learning.

Nevertheless, while the acquisition of specific competences is well assumed by the different subjects of each degree, the same is not true for cross-curricular competences. More specifically, in most engineering studies, these competences are developed indirectly through elective subjects or other complementary training activities. The main objective of this work is to design a prototype of a low-cost and open-access exoskeleton that can be used in different engineering degrees for the acquisition of cross-curricular competences. Once this prototype has been designed, we propose to use it in a practice to be carried out in the laboratory following the project-based learning methodology from a STEAM approach. With the use of a robotics kit and a project-based learning methodology, we achieve the goals of educational robotics and computational thinking in a higher education environment.},

abstract = {CS0 and CS1 courses are becoming an essential part of many social science programs, including sociology and political science. This particular assignment was designed as part of the 'Basics of Programming in Python' course for undergraduate political science students. The course aims not only to prepare students for the unified programming exam, but also to apply concepts of computational thinking in the context of political science problems. By linking these fields, students learn to overcome inner barriers in coding and explore the potential of computational social science methods for both academic path and career.  This project seeks such a connection between subjects of political science major as Comparative Electoral Systems and Quantitative Methods of Political Research, and concepts of computer science. Students process the generated votes, applying critical thinking to identify spoilt ballots, and then formulate rules for counting votes (First-past-the-post, Borda count, Condorcet winner criterion) in algorithmic form. Optionally, a short essay can be added in which students are asked to speculate about political leanings, the transitivity of preferences and the advantages/disadvantages of particular electoral systems based on analyses of the data in the assignment. As the result, students not only develop hard skills in programming, but most importantly conceptualize complicated topics through the prism of their specialization, fostering the ability to see the connections between these fields and understand how they can work together to address complex real-world scenarios.},

Since June 2022, Copilot has officially been available for free to all students as a plug-in to development environments like Visual Studio Code. Prior work exploring OpenAI Codex, the underlying model that powers Copilot, has shown it performs well on typical CS1 problems thus raising concerns about its potential impact on how introductory programming courses are taught. However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems. We find that it successfully solves around half of these problems on its very first attempt, and that it solves 60\% of the remaining problems using only natural language changes to the problem description. We argue that this type of prompt engineering, which we believe will become a standard interaction between human and Copilot when it initially fails, is a potentially useful learning activity that promotes computational thinking skills, and is likely to change the nature of code writing skill development.},

abstract = {Like digital technologies themselves, programming education is embedded in the colonial matrix of power, and access to programming knowledge demands immersion in the epistemologies of the Global North. While there is a growing body of work exploring ways to decolonise programming education, far more needs to be done. Current research focuses on the language of instruction and contextual curricula; outward-facing engagements with decolonisation. However, to move towards digital-decoloniality involves scrutinising how programming knowledge is recontextualised within curricula. Part of the project should be equipping both educators and students with the tools to recontextualise programming itself. To dismantle the colonial logic embedded in programming education, attention must be given to the knowledge formation of the discipline to identify moments of disruption. One such moment is the difficulty students face when recontextualising their mental models of computing, from programming skills to programming concepts. This occurs at the moment of reading, tracing and writing code. Programming requires one to refocus computational thinking and engage with a specific semiotic system, translating the authors’ intention into an executable computational process. Disrupting this moment using the strategies of critical literacies opens computer programming and its resulting code to critical examination, allowing an inward-facing decolonial engagement with the discipline.},

abstract = {In Computer Science (CS), modeling with diagrams is a well-known practice to visualize complex software systems or database structures. However, modeling with e.g., entity-relationship diagrams or UML (Unified Modeling Language) is also helpful in other disciplines. In this research, CS models are used as a teaching and learning tool in foreign language acquisition. The field of computer science offers a variety of models that can visualize states, as well as processes and, are therefore very suitable for the different areas of language teaching (e.g., reading, writing, grammar-, or vocabulary acquisition). With CS modeling as a teaching and learning strategy, two main objectives are addressed: enhancing learning and retention and fostering computational thinking skills. This paper presents best practice examples on how to meet these two objectives as well as the results of a crossover study, where we investigated whether vocabulary acquisition is facilitated when it is thematically preorganized in class diagrams. The results illustrate that pupils who studied with the class diagram strategy had significantly higher recall performance than pupils who studied with the list of words. A qualitative analysis of the participants’ feedback after the intervention revealed decisive criteria for their preferences regarding the learning format.},

abstract = {Integrating computational thinking (CT) into the learning of school subjects is receiving increased attention. Developing students’ CT skills may not only advance their digital literacy but it may deepen subject specific learning as well. It is therefore interesting to investigate the learning of CT from a multidisciplinary perspective. This study describes the design of a CT integrated lesson for economics in which computer models in spreadsheets are used to simulate monetary policy. The lesson is structured according to the Use-Modify-Create strategy. The aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the learning outcomes of this CT integrated lesson and students’ attitudes towards such a lesson. For this purpose, students’ exit tickets, feedback forms, supervisor observations and interviews with students have been analyzed. This qualitative analysis revealed that students perceived the lesson as difficult, especially during the Modify and Create phases. In addition, the results suggest that all phases are dependent on taking enough time to finish the Use phase to get familiar with the computational steps. Several suggestions have been given to improve the lesson, for instance, to use a simpler topic of economics. Furthermore, the analysis of students’ attitudes revealed that connections to CT could be made more explicit rather than implicitly embedded in the instructional strategy.},

We introduce LogiCraft, an educational framework for co-designing board games that teach propositional logic. The framework includes three illustrative tile-based board games: ¬ SCR∧ BL, Tautoblocks, and Deducto. These games teach propositional logic by merging computational thinking with hands-on gameplay. By integrating syntax and semantics in new ways, ¬ SCR∧ BL focuses on logic formulas construction and truth tables visualization, Tautoblocks introduces more advanced concepts of negation, tautology, and contradiction, and Deducto highlights translation and model-based reasoning. Playtesting sessions with students and teachers suggest that our games can enhance logic skills and promote cooperative learning. Our initial classroom results show potential for broader applications in game-based learning.},

abstract = {The implementation of computational thinking concepts in primary school curricula usually includes programming activities. As primary school teachers often lack subject knowledge, they may struggle to help students during these programming activities. Additional support can be provided by automated program analysis, for example in terms of hints on conceptual knowledge related to bad coding patterns observed, or procedural hints on how to solve the task at hand. However, care has to be taken since these hints need to balance (1) helping students to perform a specific task successfully, while nevertheless (2) ensuring a learning effect beyond the specific task. To understand the effects of different types of hints we therefore conducted a study with 36 children aged 7–12 in 10 programming courses. After being introduced to basic programming structures in three units, the children were tasked to debug six Scratch programs using different types of hints, where we observed that procedural hints have the strongest impact on performance. In order to examine an impact on the transfer of learned knowledge, we observed the children’s difficulties during the successive fifth unit, in which they created their own projects. The results of the fifth unit show that having received a procedural hint on a specific pattern during the fourth unit leads to slightly fewer bad related code patterns but also to slightly fewer good code patterns. Considering these results together with the subjective perceptions of the children, we can derive insights into how to best support performance and learning using (automated) feedback.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

While there is a growing body of work on developing computing identities for diverse students, little research focuses on early exposure to develop multilingual students’ interest in computing. These students represent one of the fastest growing populations in the US, yet they are dramatically underrepresented in computer science education. This study examines identity development of upper elementary multilingual students as they engage in a year-long computational thinking curriculum, and follows their engagement across multiple settings (i.e., school, club, home, community). Findings from pre- and post-surveys of identity showed significant differences favoring students’ experiences with computer science, their perceptions of computer science, their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and their family support for computer science. Findings from follow-up interviews and prior research suggest that tailored instruction provides opportunities for connections to out-of-school learning environments with friends and family that may shift students’ perceptions of their abilities to pursue computer science and persist when encountering challenges.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need to engage young learners in computational thinking (CT). Integrating digital storytelling, where students create short narratives, and CT offers significant potential for promoting interdisciplinary learning for students; however, it is critical to provide both teachers and students with automated support. A promising approach for enabling support is to leverage advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated considerable potential for assessing both programming and natural language artifacts. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to automatically assess student-created block-based programs developed using a narrative-centered learning environment that engages upper elementary students (ages 9 to 11) in learning CT and physical science through the creation of interactive science narratives. Using the narrative programs created by 28 students, we explore the efficacy of LLMs to assess the programs across two dimensions.},

Computational modelling is important in computing and many sciences, but there is a lack of research on how teachers should teach computational modelling in high schools. This study was a design-based research study with 86 teachers teaching 12 different subjects at 44 Danish high schools. The study aimed to develop a template to help design and classify didactical questions on computational modelling. Teachers participated in one of two courses on computational modelling. The intervention group (Prog+) included an introduction to agent-based modelling and programming in NetLogo. The comparison group (Prog-) included a general introduction to agent-based modelling. A template consisting of 16 modelling parameters was developed with teachers. Results showed that the template was helpful for teachers to design didactical questions and for the research team to classify the taxonomical levels of these questions. A total of 51 teaching activities were developed by teachers and didactical questions were derived. The strength of this design based research study was that it included a control group and inspired teachers to design and evaluate didactical questions in computational modelling in a wide range of high school subjects. Future studies are needed to evaluate the validity of the template.},

abstract = {This lightning talk describes our current efforts to isolate and identify potential threshold concepts and threshold capabilities which are experienced by intermediate computer science undergraduate students. We are utilizing the theoretical framework as described by Meyer, Land, Bowden, and Baillie. Two of the key identifiable characteristics surrounding a threshold concept are (1) the transformation one undergoes as a result of incorporating the concept into their knowledge and (2) the state of uncertainty (liminality) experienced as the learner develops this understanding. As a result of this transformation and the resultant traversal of a liminal state, elements of an identity are often developed. For the computer science undergraduate, we hypothesize that advanced computational thinking skills are developed along with these transformations leading to the development of a computer scientist identity. Through identification of the threshold concepts/capabilities experienced by intermediate students the potential corollary concepts behind computational thinking may be uncovered as well. The overall project intends to integrate elements of threshold concepts, liminality, and transformative learning to produce a framework through which computational thinking can be probed and students' progression can be better assessed and supported. These efforts are only beginning - curious faculty and students are invited to attend our presentation and consider potential collaborative participation in our endeavors.},

abstract = {Learning trajectories are paths that students may follow in order to achieve their learning goals. Although the literature has addressed the subject, little has been done in the way of exploring how to visualize learning trajectories. In this paper, we present three forms of interactive learning trajectories visualizations linked to the context of computational thinking. As the interactions on visualizations involved different aspects, our proposal comprises three layers: the data representation, the reactions to the navigation and data exploration where more details of the data can be seen. Due to visualizations being tightly related to the context from which the data comes, we analyzed the data types available in Code.org, a well-known platform commonly used to teach computational thinking. To assess the three visualizations, we carried out usability and user experience evaluation with 23 Brazilian elementary schools teachers. The results revealed that the three visualizations achieved an average of 72\% of overall understanding by the audience. Besides, our findings showed the visualizations were well accepted among the participants. We also found out that the user experience reported by the participants is in some way associated with the level of understanding of the visualizations.},

abstract = {This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.},

Using a fixed-effects regression methodology with course-taking records from New York City, we examine the association between CS instruction and course grades for high school students. We find small positive associations between CS instruction and end-of-year grades in English, Math, Science, and Social Studies.},

The current study compared American and Indonesian middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and CS attitudes. Concurrently, this study also examined whether the items in the instruments we used exhibit country, gender, or prior CS experience measurement biases. A total of 592 American n = 242 and Indonesian n = 350 middle school students took a CT assessment and CS attitudes scale. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to detect biased items, and a two-way ANOVA was utilized to examine the interaction effects of country and gender in the two constructs. The results showed some items were flagged as having country-specific DIF. The results also indicated that the American students had higher CT scores than Indonesian students. However, Indonesian students obtained higher CS attitudes scores compared to American students. Further results showed a significant gender difference in CS attitudes in the American samples; however, such a significant difference was not found in the Indonesian sample. These findings underscore the importance of a country's socio-cultural context in influencing gender diversity in the CS field.},

In this paper, we present the curriculum design, implementation, and results from a one-trimester introductory Python course that is mandatory for all 8th graders in our school district. This course is a crucial component of the K-12 computational thinking pathways we are developing at our school district, which take students from block-based programming and computational thinking (elementary school) to text-based programming and applications of computer science (high school). Our mandatory 8th grade course serves as a bridge between these two components. We present qualitative results that highlight the challenges that arose from teaching a course for all students -- not just those with a prior interest in computing -- and how the instructor overcame those challenges. We also present quantitative results that demonstrate the course's positive impact on students' attitudes towards computer science, their intent to re-engage with computer science in the future, and the gender gap with regards to confidence in computer science.},

abstract = {Research has shown that free-form Game-Design (GD) environments can be very effective in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, some students can still need some guidance during the learning process due to the highly open-ended nature of these environments. Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) can be used to provide personalized assistance in real-time to alleviate this challenge. This paper presents our results in evaluating such an agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Building from these results, we provide insights on how to provide IPA interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.},

To solve the problems of data bias and feature mismatch that may occur in learner modeling on heterogeneous data, this paper uses the method of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to accurately portray the features of learners' thinking skills and construct a classification model for top talents. First, by analyzing the thinking skills that have the greatest impact on top talents, the features of critical thinking skills, logical thinking skills and computational thinking skills are extracted separately. Then, a learner classification model for top talents was constructed by MKL method. Finally, the model was validated on the dataset and compared with the results of single-kernel learning. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the classification model for top talents based on MKL is significantly better than that of ordinary single-kernel learning, which indicates that the method of MKL performs better in the learner classification model.},

abstract = {As computer science is integrated into a wider variety of fields, block-based programming languages like Snap!, which assemble code with visual blocks rather than text syntax, are increasingly used to teach computational thinking (CT) to students from diverse backgrounds. Although automated evaluators (autograders) for programming assignments usually focus on runtime efficiency and output accuracy, effective evaluation of a student's CT skills requires assessing coding best practices, such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design. While autograders are commonplace for text languages like Python, we present a machine learning approach to assess how effectively block-based code demonstrates understanding of CT fundamentals. Our dataset consists of Snap! programs written by students new to coding and evaluated by instructors using a CT rubric. We explore how to best transform these programs into low-dimensional features to allow encapsulation and repetition patterns to emerge. Experimentation involves comparing the effectiveness of a suite of clustering models and similarity metrics by analyzing how directly automated feedback correlates to the course staff's manual evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical application of the autograder in a classroom setting and discuss scalability and feasibility in other domains of CS education.},

abstract = {Teaching students to become skillful problem solvers is a goal of university education, but it has been difficult to measure such skill or demonstrate the benefits of particular educational experiences. This paper presents a study of college students solving a problem unrelated to their academic majors. The analysis suggests that the educational experiences of Computer Science (CS) students may better train them in problem-solving than the experiences of other majors. In this study, students from a variety of undergraduate majors and grade levels were given a 15-minute problem-solving task embedded in an interactive science simulation. The complex task calls upon many problem-solving practices needed by scientists and engineers in their professions. Although this task has little resemblance to the problems encountered in a computer science course, CS students performed significantly better than students in any other major. In addition, only for CS students was there an indication of improvement in problem-solving from lower to upper grade levels. We propose that general problem-solving and computational thinking share some common practices, such as problem decomposition and comprehensive data collection. Furthermore, we present preliminary evidence that training in computational thinking is transferable to problem-solving tasks across domains and discuss how the unique features of CS programming assignments could be generalized to other science and engineering courses to foster students' general problem-solving skills.},

The findings reveal the lopsided gender representation in coding kits, e.g., their physical forms and supported coding activities are predominantly boy-oriented. We discuss design and research implications for coding kits to welcome participation from children of different genders, especially young girls whose preferred design features are underrepresented in current designs.},

abstract = {Adversarial Thinking (AT) is essential in cybersecurity, fostering strategic problem-solving by anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, its integration into early computing education, especially in the first two years, remains underexplored. Introductory courses like CS 0 build foundational skills but are challenging to implement in resource-limited community colleges. Strengthening AT in these students can enhance their workforce readiness and support transfers to four-year programs. Servingness describes how Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) go beyond merely enrolling Latinx students to address their specific cultural, academic, and social needs. It involves creating inclusive environments where students feel a strong sense of belonging, supported by culturally relevant practices, leadership opportunities, and community engagement. These environments generate feelings of being accepted, valued, and included within a community or group, also called a sense of belonging. This work presents research focused on the incorporation of AT within the first two years of computer science education at community colleges, in particular to a course CS 0. By examining the integration of AT principles in early coursework, the study identifies key characteristics and a sense of belonging that are instrumental in cultivating AT capabilities among students. The findings aim to offer actionable insights for educators in community colleges, enabling them to more effectively prepare students for the complexities of modern computing careers and to address the broader needs of the cybersecurity field. Through this targeted educational approach, students can develop a more robust understanding of adversarial strategies, enhancing their overall computational thinking and problem-solving skills.},

A case study of one teacher’s experience implementing the unit with a group of middle school students (ages 11 to 14) in her STEM elective class examines how her students could still engage in computational thinking practices around data and programming.

To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items. The significance of this paper is to present a new CT measure for upper elementary students and to share its intentional development process.},

abstract = {With the growing demand for computational skills in the job market, it's imperative that lower secondary school students grasp basic programming concepts such as repetition, modularity, conditionals, and variables. Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills.This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach "multi-context physical computing'' to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory.In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study.},

abstract = {During peer-led intensive events (such as hackathons and coding camps), students actively assist others to learn and, in turn, benefit from an effective learning environment. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.},

abstract = {Many children begin to learn to code in a self-directed context, such as by creating an animation, game or phone app. Recent research has begun to investigate and evaluate the results of this process: children's projects. However, little is known about the different trajectories novices have during the long-term process of self-directed programming learning. Our aim is to identify the existing types of trajectories and be able to determine a specific child's trajectory. If that trajectory does not lead to significant progress or continued motivation, we might be able to nudge them toward a different trajectory.We hypothesized that there may be several main types of trajectories. To explore this, we clustered children's programming progression in order to identify trends. We used a data set of Scratch programs for its large sample size and diverse population [1,3]. We used Dr. Scratch's scoring of computational thinking skills as our initial feature set [2]. Our clustering analysis identified two main groups of users. The first group, 55.8\% of users, generally progressed upward over time in their computational thinking skill score. The second group, 44.2\% of users, showed little to no improvement over time.These preliminary results raise many questions about these two high-level groupings of trajectories of computational thinking skill demonstration in Scratch projects. In the future we want to further explore the trajectory clusters and what they could mean for supporting self-directed learning of programming.},

However, game development can be challenging for younger developers who lack formal training. While teenage developers frequently turn to online communities for peer support, their experiences may vary. To better understand the benefits and challenges teens face within online developer communities, we conducted interviews with 18 teenagers who created games or elements in Roblox and received peer support from one or more online Roblox developer communities. Our findings show that developer communities provide teens with valuable resources for technical, social, and career growth. However, teenagers also struggle with inter-user conflicts and a lack of community structure, leading to difficulties in handling complex issues that may arise, such as financial scams. Based on these insights, we propose takeaways for creating positive and safe online spaces for teenage game creators.},

abstract = {Computer scientists have been working towards a common definition of abstraction; however, the instruction and assessment of abstraction remain categorically under-researched. Abstraction is often cited as a component of computational thinking and can be likened to a higher order thinking skill. Most K-12 educators have studied critical thinking (e.g., Bloom's taxonomy, Marzano \&amp; Kendall's new taxonomy) more than computational thinking. Overlapping characteristics of abstraction and critical thinking can provide educators with instructional guidance. The qualitative examination of how teachers determine curriculum, deliver instruction, and design assessments in K-12 computer science education contributes insights into current instructional practices and variables for future quantitative study. The instructional strategies, objectives, and assessments of 12 K-12 computer science teachers from three states in the United States were examined in this descriptive qualitative examination of instruction using thematic coding analysis. The majority of teachers interviewed had little to no professional development regarding teaching abstraction. All teachers in the study were unsure what student abstraction abilities should be according to grade level. Teachers' understanding of abstraction ranged from very little knowledge to very knowledgeable. The majority of teachers interviewed did not assess abstraction intentionally. Teachers described successfully teaching abstraction through multiple instructional practices and spiraling curriculum. This examination of abstraction in K-12 computer science education offers practical descriptive insights and illuminates additional variables for researching the instruction of abstraction qualitatively and quantitatively. Anecdotal instructional successes are included in the results.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovation that is rapidly transforming industries from agriculture to medicine, enabling advances such as real-time data monitoring and remote control. However, IoT's infiltration into education has been much slower, and educational tools that embody these features are few and far between. Together with the Chugach School District in Alaska, we investigated methods to teach middle-school aged students how to use IoT to drive change in their communities and collaborate in a digital world, tied to real time environmental data. The objective of this work is to provide rural, K-12 Alaskan students and teachers with opportunities that will help build an understanding of what is happening in their local environments, increase overall scientific and climate literacy, and contribute to community resilience and connectedness. Rural Alaskan students live in some of the most vulnerable regions of the planet, regions that are highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. In this work-in-progress paper, we first discuss the design and adaptation of Tekniverse, a hardware and software ecosystem that provides a gateway for students to code and connect hardware projects and data. We then discuss the finding of our initial study of Tekniverse as a learning tool for computational thinking, data analysis, and social responsibility in rural and remote areas with students in Alaska. Lastly, we propose future directions for this research and computational collaborative tools.},

However, how to best perform this integration is not yet known, nor is there likely to be one ''best'' method. In this session, we will facilitate a discussion of the variety of ways in which post-secondary institutions are actively using computing to support disciplinary learning by highlighting examples while also considering mechanisms not yet explored. We invite anyone who wants to learn more about current efforts, share their own experiences, and contribute ideas for future endeavors. In an effort to maximize the diversity of perspectives in this discussion, we've included discussion leaders who span a variety of roles within curriculum development and classroom instruction and encourage participants from all levels and backgrounds.},

abstract = {Background and Context. With increasing efforts to bring computing education opportunities into elementary schools, there is a growing need for assessments, with arguments for validity, to support research evaluation at these grade levels. After successfully piloting a 10-question computational thinking assessment (Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students – ACES) for 4th graders in Spring 2020, we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment. Objectives. To increase the number of potential items for ACES, we created isomorphic versions of existing questions. The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not believe would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty. We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance. Method. Using these isomorphic questions, we created two versions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper-elementary (4th grade) students. We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach’s alpha. We used Chi-squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assessments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi-Squared and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions. Findings. Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability, with identical Cronbach’s alphas of 0.868. We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students, allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions. Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions, indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance. Implications. This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions. We provide valuable lessons learned, both on those methods and on the impact of specific types of changes on student performance.},

abstract = {Biowaste, encompassing food waste and agricultural residues, poses significant environmental challenges while offering transformative opportunities. Traditionally relegated to landfills or incineration, biowaste is increasingly recognized as a renewable resource for producing biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, and animal feed. This review offers a systems-level analysis of biowaste characteristics, conversion processes, and derived bioenergy products such as biofuels, biogas, biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioelectricity, and other valuable chemicals. Diverse conversion methods are explored, including anaerobic digestion, fermentation, microbial fuel cells, pyrolysis, and gasification, alongside conventional practices like landfilling and incineration. Emerging analytical advancements are revolutionizing biowaste valorization. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are highlighted for their transformative impact. For example, AI-driven optimization of pyrolysis conditions has enhanced biochar yield and quality, while predictive modeling using neural networks has improved the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) demonstrates a significant reduction in operational costs through AI-driven process optimization, and life cycle assessment (LCA) quantifies reductions in environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, due to AI-informed process adjustments. Advanced assessment tools, including material flow analysis (MFA), further evaluate resource dynamics within biowaste-to-energy systems. Artificial intelligence and ML optimize waste processing, improving efficiency and product quality. Key analytical tools like TEA, LCA, and MFA assess the financial and environmental viability of these processes.}

However, can human resource professionals rely on algorithms for prediction? Can they decide when the process of prediction is not known? Due to the lack of interpretability, ML models' exclusive nature and growing intricacy make it challenging for field experts to comprehend these multifaceted black boxes. To address the concern of interpretability, trust and transparency of black-box predictions, this study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in identifying the factors that escalate the ECn, analysing the negative impact on productivity, employee morale and financial stability. We propose a predictive model that compares the best two top-performing algorithms based on the performance metrics. Thereafter, we suggest applying an explainable artificial intelligence based on Shapley values, i.e., the Shapley Additive exPlanations approach (SHAP), to identify and compare the feature importance of top-performing algorithms logistic regression and random forest analysis on our dataset. The interpretability of the predictive outcome unboxes the predictions, enhancing trust and facilitating retention strategies.}

In order to reduce emissions, the EU has established reduction targets and adopted new regulations that set emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. A significant area of focus in recent literature has been the reduction of emissions through the utilisation of low-carbon vehicles. This case study aims to develop a Total Cost of Ownership model for low-carbon heavy-duty vehicles. This has been achieved by employing empirical data and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the viability of the available fuel options. The dataset comprised telemetry data collected from January to October 2023 from a Finnish food logistics company utilising low-carbon fuel options. The findings indicate that, within the context of the studied vehicles, liquid biomethane and electric trucks are currently cost-competitive alternatives. In 82% of cases, electric vehicle trucks exhibited a lower total cost of ownership than diesel or liquid biomethane trucks. Electric vehicles were best suited for shorter hauls, typically under 390 km, due to their limited range and thus higher cost per kilometre. Contribution of this paper is empirical demonstration showing that liquid biomethane vehicles offer the greatest overall potential for cost and emissions cost savings compared to diesel and is the most technically feasible option, but it also has the most cost uncertainty.}

This paper investigates how different optimization objectives and varying climatic conditions shape optimal building configurations. This paper explores these performance objectives through an optimization framework that merges genetic algorithms with simulation techniques, leveraging the Energy Plus platform and incorporating embodied impact databases that include energy and carbon emission factors. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation and optimization of operational and embodied energy, as well as carbon footprints. It also highlights the complexities of the energy-carbon relationship across different climate and energy scenarios. The methodology is applied to a representative office building model in two distinct optimization phases in current and future scenarios. The first phase optimizes the interconnected operational and embodied energy, whereas the second phase operational and embodied carbon emissions. Under current weather conditions, the first phase achieves a 28.17 % reduction in total primary energy consumption compared to the original design. In the second phase, the framework results in a 21.85 % decrease in the total carbon footprint. When future weather scenarios are examined, the first phase yields a 26.36 % reduction in total primary energy use, followed by a 17.9 % decrease in total carbon emissions in the second phase. These findings illustrate the significance of optimizing the energy and environmental impacts of buildings in current and future scenarios.}

abstract = {The increasing global demand for English Medium Instruction (EMI) in higher education (HE) highlights the need for empirical research to contribute to its success and suggest ways of mitigating the diverse challenges faced by students and institutions. Identifying the key factors that contribute to successful EMI is critical for improving both content and language learning outcomes for students. In the wake of the recent surge in EMI research, more research synthesis is needed to understand how these factors interact to influence EMI success rather than focusing solely on their isolated, bivariate relationships. To address this gap, we conducted meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) to examine the structural relationships among the key factors affecting the success of EMI. Synthesising data from 50 studies (N = 15,032), our analysis demonstrates that learners’ engagement and English proficiency are pivotal for both content and language learning, with English proficiency being more important for language learning outcomes, although itself considerably also influenced by learners’ anxiety and motivation. Additionally, the moderator analysis shows that learner engagement plays a more significant role in partial EMI contexts, leading to our recommendation for differentiated institutional support in full and partial EMI settings. However, owing to the limited availability of correlation coefficients, some key factors and moderators were excluded, prompting the need for further empirical research to explore these relationships in greater depth.}

abstract = {The mental representation of time recruits spatial representations, but is space an essential, inescapable feature of mental time? Supporting a positive answer to this question, recent research has reported that lateral (left–right) space is automatically activated in lexical decision tasks in which the temporal reference of the words is irrelevant for the goals of the task (implicit tasks). Here, using always the same set of Spanish verbs and pseudoverbs marked for past or future tense, we assess the space–time congruency effect in reaction time and mouse trajectories, both in an explicit time judgement task and an implicit lexical decision task. Moreover, we report the first confirmatory (preregistered) study in this field of research using long lateral movements in lexical decision. The congruency effect was always significant in time judgement, but non-significant in lexical decision. Moreover, in reaction time this effect was significantly smaller than a Smallest Effect Size Of Interest (SESOI) of 10 ms, and even smaller than a recently reported 9 ms effect. Therefore, it was considered negligible. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence for an automatic activation of the lateral mental timeline in lexical decision.}

These materials exhibit a substantial surface area and an orderly arrangement of interconnected pores, typically ranging in diameter from 2 to 50 nanometers. The term 'mesoporous' signifies that the pore size falls between the microporous range (less than 2 nanometers) and the macroporous range (greater than 50 nanometers). On the other hand, 'Nanohybrids' represent composite materials that amalgamate two or more types of nanoparticles or nanoscale structures to form a novel material with distinctive properties and functions. The exceptional characteristics enable rapid ion diffusion, a substantial specific surface area, and enhanced sites for adsorption and reactions. Consequently, they offer a promising solution for the fabrication of high-performance electrode and catalyst materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. This review primarily offers a brief about various nanomaterials for supercapacitors and their recent advancements. Secondly, it delves into the various methods of synthesizing mesoporous nanomaterials and nanohybrids, with a particular focus on template-based, template-free, and chemical approaches.

abstract = {Background and objective
The Gene Ontology (GO) project has been pivotal in providing a structured framework for characterizing genes and annotating them to specific biological concepts. While traditional gene annotation primarily focuses on mapping genes to GO terms, descriptors of biological concepts, there is a growing need for tools facilitating reverse querying. This paper introduces GOReverseLookup, a novel tool designed to identify over- or underrepresented genes in researcher-defined states of interest (phenotypes), described by sets of GO terms. GOReverseLookup supplements the existing power of Gene Ontology by the possibility of orthologous gene querying across several databases, such as Ensembl and UniProtKB. This combination allows for a more nuanced identification of significant genes across a range of cross-species research contexts.
Methods
GOReverseLookup queries genes associated with input GO terms. Bundles of GO terms encapsulate user-defined states of interest, e.g., angiogenesis. In the second stage of the analysis, all GO terms associated with each gene are fetched, and finally, the statistical relevance of the genes being involved in one (or all) of the defined states of interests is computed.
Results
The two presented use cases illustrate its utility in discovering genes related to rheumatoid arthritis and genes linked with chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. In both cases, GOReverseLookup discovered a substantial number of genes significantly associated with the aforementioned states of interest.
Conclusions
GOReverseLookup proves to be a valuable resource for unraveling the genetic basis of phenotypes, with diverse practical potentials in functional genomics, systems biology, and drug discovery. We anticipate that GOReverseLookup will significantly aid in identifying potential gene targets during the initial research phases.}

The study draws on a design-based research study on process drama in upper-secondary school chemistry teaching which was conducted in collaboration with two teachers. During the process drama, the students and teachers travel in time to explore the uses of plastic; the motives and needs for using plastic as well as the consequences of plastic use in the form of plastic pollution today and in the future. The collected data consist of video- and audio recordings, which were analysed through qualitative content analysis that discerned how the students connected the temporalities, and which dimensions of the plastic problem were made visible in the temporal movements in the process drama. Our findings indicate that the temporal transitions made visible several dimensions of the plastic issue, and contributed to adding layers of complexity to the issue of plastics.}

Within this model, not only is caring not a prerequisite of urban production, but decade(s)in of smartification and platformization practices shows diminishing the spaces, infrastructure, and socio-economic relations that were co-produced to generate care. Through the lens of feminist geography, care is examined as a multidimensional concept encompassing socio-spatial dynamics, power relations, and ethical urban practices. Using empirical data from three research projects, the study showcases alternative digital urbanism practices, categorized into three vignettes: refusal, commoning, and reappropriation. These categories are illustrated with cases such as grassroots food cooperatives, feminist hack-spaces, digital sovereignty initiatives, platform-based welfare experiments and civil society initiatives such as Code for Germany. By situating care within the spatial and social fabric of urban life, the paper argues for its potential as a politic, practice, and epistemology that challenges the exploitative logic of contemporary digital infrastructures. The findings reveal the embeddedness of care practices within local contexts, highlighting the dual need for trans-local networks and territorial embeddedness. This study contributes to the discourse on caring digital urbanism, advancing a feminist theorisation of everyday digital urbanism.}

One of the most important components of E-mobility is the electric motor, which must be designed for high torque, a wide speed range, and high efficiency at all speeds. Hence, significant research has been conducted on modeling, analyzing, and designing various electric motors like Brushless DC Motors (BLDCM), Induction Motors (IM), Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM), Switched Reluctance Motors (SRM), and Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRM) and Permanent Magnet Assisted Synchronous Reluctance Motors (PMaSynRM) for E-mobility applications. These motors face several challenges in modeling, analyzing, and designing, such as handling nonlinearity, accurate thermal modeling, and selecting suitable tools/materials. Also, new motors like Permanent Magnet Synchronous Reluctance Motors (PMSynRM) have been introduced by different EV manufacturers. Hardly any research or reviews are available for dynamic modeling, performance analysis, and design optimization of PMSynRM. Accurate dynamic modeling, performance analysis, and design optimization can support industry and academia in developing improved motor modeling and designs. There is little attention paid to research reviews in the above areas. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed review of the modeling, analysis, and design of various motors, including new motors used in E-mobility applications. Furthermore, this review investigates the research challenges and future scopes in modeling, analyzing, and designing. Also, various motors are compared in terms of speed, torque, torque ripple, efficiency, weight, and cost. The review concludes that identified research challenges should be immediately addressed to achieve targeted net-zero goals.}

Its core goal is to identify and screen out the feature subset that is most critical to the prediction target from the extensive initial attribute collection, in a bid to improve the efficiency and generalization of the model and reduce the computational complexity. A stochastic fractal equilibrium optimizer based on X-shaped dynamic transfer function is targeted for large-scale feature selection. Among them, the X-shaped transfer function is designed based on the scaling and flip changes of the basic transfer functions, and then the parameters related to the number of iterations in the equilibrium optimizer (EO) are further used as time-varying factors to dynamically change the X-shaped transfer function. The flower-shaped transfer function and dynamic flower-shaped transfer function are extended. At the same time, EO is optimized and improved by using the diffusion and updating process in the stochastic fractal search. To assess the efficacy and dominance of the designed FS method, 20 large-scale datasets were picked from UCI datasets for experiments, and SFEO-TF with the best performance was selected and set against 8 other intelligent optimization approaches. The experimental results show that the designed dynamic time-varying X-shaped transfer function is effective as well as the EO based on stochastic fractal search. Among them, in the two groups of controlled experiments, SFEO-TF has the best performance in performance metric and categorization precision, and even the performance of SFEO-TF set against 8 other intelligent optimization approaches in the minimum fitness value of all 20 large-scale datasets has reached the minimum value.}

This ship can lift, transport, collect, and transfer kelp in a single operation. Apart from the manual assistance required for the release and hanging the seedling rope, all other processes are mechanically automated. The diameter and lead of the rotary-screw propulsor blade were determined through Fluent simulation tests. To verify the actual harvesting effect of the three-body kelp harvesting ship, kelp harvesting performance tests were conducted. The results showed that the working speed and efficiency of mechanized harvesting were significantly higher than manual. The mechanical harvesting efficiency was 18.75 times that of manual, and the per capita harvesting efficiency was 9.33 times that of manual. The kelp loss rate of the harvesting ship was 3.25 %, slightly higher than that of manual. This study can provide a certain reference for the mechanized harvesting of kelp in large-scale aquaculture.}

This paper focuses on three-way conflict analysis models based on an incomplete Pythagorean fuzzy situation table (IPFST). Following the principles of three-way decision, we propose a 3×3 approach for three-way conflict analysis grounded in the IPFST. The first 3 indicates the support-opposition-neutral triad, which deals with missing values in the IPFST from three different perspectives and is known as a three-way supplement method. We use this method to convert the IPFST into three complete Pythagorean fuzzy situation tables (CPFSTs), which are called the CPFSTs induced by the three-way supplement method. The second 3 represents the agent pairs-agents-issues triad, which is the basic task of trisecting agent pairs, agents, and issues for each part of the first 3. More specifically, we categorize agent pairs into conflict, neutrality, and alliance relations, classify agents into opposition, neutral, and support coalitions, and divide issues into main, secondary, and irrelevant reasons. In addition, we discuss maximum coalitions and feasible strategies for conflict resolution. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the 3×3 approach through a case study.}

This study investigates the link between creativity and suicide among modern and contemporary Chinese poets by employing computational techniques to analyze semantic creativity in their works. Examining 16 poets who died by suicide alongside 21 non-suicidal counterparts, we introduced a dual model that combines flow distance and co-occurrence networks to assess creative cognition. The findings indicate that suicidal poets exhibit significantly higher local and global flow distances, reflecting greater divergent thinking. Furthermore, their co-occurrence networks display more tightly interconnected and efficient structures, suggesting enhanced cognitive flexibility. By demonstrating that heightened creativity, characterized by distinct semantic network properties, is associated with mental health challenges, the study provides empirical support for the "mad genius" hypothesis.

In learning about robotics, educational robotics are merely the learning objects or contents by learners. In learning through robotics, educational robotics serve as the learning tools or assists, and learners can take their agency to operate or design robotics. In learning from robotics, educational robotics act as tutors to convey and deliver knowledge and information to learners. In learning with robotics, educational robotics serve as the peers or companions of learners and collaborate with learners to provide emotional supports, solve problems and construct knowledge. Furthermore, this study examined the applied educational contexts (i.e., educational domain, educational level) and learning effects of the four robotic roles.

Traditional methods often result in over- or under-fertilization, leading to economic losses and environmental pollution. Fuzzy inference systems have shown promise in decision-making for precision agriculture, but the accuracy of fertilizer recommendations hinges on the defuzzification method. This paper introduces a novel framework, the adaptive intelligent fertilizer optimization system (AIFOS), comprising three phases. The first phase enhances the FIS through adaptive membership function design, specifically employing Gaussian membership functions. The second phase introduces data-driven defuzzification innovation, in which parameters are optimized through a hybrid optimization algorithm called hybrid somersault panda search optimization (HSPSO), which combines red panda optimization (RPO) and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO). A multi-objective fitness function is explored to address yield maximization, cost optimization, and environmental impact. The third phase focuses on adaptive knowledge update and feedback, integrating reinforcement learning techniques for real-time learning and adaptation. The proposed framework aims to significantly improve the accuracy, robustness, and sustainability of fertilizer recommendations in precision agriculture.}

We introduce a neural-network-based framework for rapidly mapping extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra onto structural parameters as an alternative to the commonly used non-linear least-squares fitting approaches. Our method leverages multilayer perceptron trained on theoretical EXAFS and validated against theoretical test data and experimental spectra of frequently used nanoparticle types. The network helps lower the correlation between parameters, achieves high accuracy in the presence of noise and glitches, and can provide real-time parameter predictions with minimal user intervention. Parameter uncertainties are estimated as well. This method can be readily integrated into beamline pipelines or laboratory data analysis workflow and has the potential to accelerate high-throughput and catalyst characterization and testing.}

The present study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of AI-powered personalized learning interventions on these key constructs. A total of 183 intermediate-level Chinese male EFL learners were randomly assigned either to an experimental group (EG), which received AI-personalized instruction, or to a control group (CG), which engaged in traditional instruction methods. Data were gathered through pre- and post-intervention surveys and analyzed using independent t-tests. Results indicated that compared to participants in the CG, learners in the EG exhibited statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy, motivation, and digital literacy. These findings offer robust empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of AI-personalized instructional strategies in enhancing essential learner attributes within the adult male EFL context in China. Thus, the study advocates for the strategic integration of AI-powered personalized learning, highlighting its considerable potential to optimize language learning outcomes within adult EFL education.}

However, current models struggle with low accuracy, high computational costs, and poor interpretability when detecting faults in insulated bearings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel lightweight spatiotemporal model-based intelligent diagnostic framework, named LSBT-Net, which aims to identify motor insulating bearing faults in practical engineering applications more accurately. Specifically, this research breaks the conventional thinking of “learning fault data feature information” by innovatively developing a spatiotemporal information fusion module. This module is cleverly integrated into the LSBT-Net framework, enabling the extraction of both local and global high-dimensional fault feature information from insulating bearings. At the same time, based on a lightweight design, it significantly reduces the total number of parameters and computational resources required by the framework, thus lowering its computational complexity. The t-SNE algorithm is introduced into the LSBT-Net framework to achieve local or global interpretability. Furthermore, by calculating the gradient information of the LSBT-Net framework on the fault types of insulating bearings through backpropagation, the interpretability of the framework with respect to the physical information is enhanced. Using insulating bearings and typical fault experiments as examples, the LSBT-Net framework demonstrates excellent diagnostic capability and generalization performance compared to other advanced methods.}

As key virulence factors, these toxins cause significant tissue damage and disease manifestations in infected hosts. Vaccination against these toxins through toxoid vaccines, composed of inactivated forms of the toxins, represents a vital strategy for preventing toxin-mediated diseases. However, creating effective toxoid vaccines necessitates meticulous detoxification processes that ensure the loss of toxicity while retaining the immunogenic properties inherent in the native toxins. This review offers a comprehensive evaluation of the diverse methodologies employed for detoxifying bacterial toxins, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and implications for vaccine development. By detailing comparisons of efficacy, stability, residual toxicity, and clinical applicability, we demonstrate that while traditional methods utilizing chemical reagents (such as formaldehyde) remain widely used, emerging technologies like genetic inactivation and protein engineering present significant advantages. These innovations promise to advance the development of durable and irreversible toxoid vaccines that protect public health and contribute to future vaccine formulation improvements. Ultimately, this knowledge synthesis aims to guide future research efforts and facilitate the design of safer and more effective toxoid vaccines to combat the public health threats posed by toxin-producing bacteria.}

This manuscript delves into various nanomaterials and methods-based systems designed to address these drawbacks. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems, including magnetic, gold, selenium, and liposomal nanoparticles, as well as polymeric and mesoporous silica carriers, have demonstrated significant potential to overcome Berberine’s pharmacokinetic limitations.

The manuscript also frameworks an in-depth analysis of BBR's underlying pharmacological mechanism, various synergistic studies, clinical trials, and associated patent data. By employing nano-BBR with surface modification, we could sidestep the constraints of traditional forms by attenuating regrettable attributes of BBR. Implementation of combinatorial chemistry, in addition to the in-silico approach, might refine the clinical outcomes of BBR. However, steering into regulatory complexity is important, which may affect its market success because of its physiological drawbacks.}

Firstly, this study introduces two novel deep learning models for predicting RNA methylation sites: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based and transformer-based models. These models are trained and evaluated on human and mouse benchmark datasets for m1A, m6A, m5C, and A to I, methylation types. Secondly, this work investigates the effect of different encoding techniques on model performance, including one-hot encoding, Gene2Vec, and position encoding, as well as their combinations using concatenation, summation, and multiplication. Thirdly, this study also aims to investigate the prediction strength of motif-based and attention-based classifiers. The obtained results demonstrate that both models achieve high accuracy in predicting RNA methylation sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple performance metrics. Moreover, the selection of encoding strategy has a substantial impact on prediction accuracy; the best approaches vary based on the particular species and type of methylation. The findings also indicate that the motif-based classifier is more stable than the attention-based classification when predicting RNA methylation. In the future, we aim to expand our research beyond human and mouse models to explore RNA methylation in plants.}

abstract = {The coming of the post-digital workplace? A survey of how white-collar workers experience and cope with digital media reliance. New media technology can both hamper and amplify workers' agency. Much research shows that the ambiguities of digital reliance are accentuated among office workers, especially knowledge workers, who spend most of their working time handling different types of information and data. Thus, in times of constant connectivity, people might feel compelled to create time-spaces for disconnection, or find spatial and temporal routines for restricting their use of digital tools. This article provides a quantitative analysis, based on a survey, of how private and public officials (“white-collar workers”) in Sweden experience and handle digital media reliance at work, with a special focus on whether they think communicative and territorial agency are enhanced or constrained under digitalized working conditions. Based on a principal component analysis (PCA), five dispositions toward (the handling of) digital media reliance are identified: the skepctical, the embracing, the captivated, the reluctant and the disciplined. These dispositions are further analyzed in relation to demographic and contextual variables, pointing especially to the significance of employment sector. While digital media reliance is appreciated and associated with extended agency by many informants, the study also reveals different facets of post-digital sentiments and tactics. These are particularly constitutive of the skeptical disposition, reflecting inclinations to avoid certain media and find alternatives to digital tools, but also in the disciplined disposition which encompasses internalized routines for media use. The study also shows that the normalization of digitalized work processes is entwined with, and necessitates, different forms of territorial micro-politics extending beyond the workplace per se.}

To conduct a comprehensive assessment of glass elements, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of both glass and SHM sciences. This research aims to explore various approaches for implementing SHM on structural glass elements, with a specific focus on the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques.

Few species engage in coalitional aggression, even though the social conditions that would favor its evolution seem to be widespread. Why? Forming coalitions to exploit these opportunities requires individuals to solve highly complex and specialized information processing problems involving cooperation, coordination, and social exchange. The difficulty of evolving cognitive mechanisms capable of solving these problems—especially when the individuals involved are not kin—may explain why multi-individual coalitions are phylogenetically rare. We propose that humans and a few other cognitively pre-adapted species have evolved specialized cognitive programs that govern coalitional behavior, which constitute a distinctive coalitional psychology. To derive a preliminary map of this psychology, we started with a task analysis of the adaptive information-processing problems that arise during coalitional aggression. This exercise can shine light on our evolved psychology because algorithms that motivate and organize coalitional aggression would need design features that solve these problems well to be favored by selection. These problems include decisions about when to form a coalition or join one, when to initiate an attack, and how to allocate the costs and benefits that result from coalitional action. The risk contract of war identifies circumstances under which natural selection would favor decisions to initiate an attack. When the conditions of this model are met, mortality rates will not negatively impact the fitness of males in the winning coalition. This outcome has implications for the design of computational systems that motivate coalitional attacks; it may explain why warfare is so favored an activity among men, despite its risks to the participating individuals' welfare.}

This study presents a novel hybrid energy system that integrates renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines, conventional diesel generators, battery storage, and distribution grids to reliably satisfy the charging demands of electric vehicles in urban environments. A Hybrid Grey Wolf Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HGWCSA), which synergistically combines the exploitation capabilities of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and the exploration strengths of Cuckoo Search (CS), is employed to optimize the system’s sizing and operational performance of the charging system. The primary advantages of HGWCSA include faster convergence, superior solution accuracy, and robust capability to avoid local optima. The effectiveness and innovation of HGWCSA are validated through comparative performance assessments against conventional metaheuristic algorithms. The study further contributes novel insights by thoroughly assessing techno-economic feasibility, socio-economic opportunities, strategic policies, and implementation challenges within the context of sustainable e-mobility from a case study perspective in the Arabian Peninsula. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate that the HGWCSA achieves the lowest Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) at $0.08/kWh and the minimum Total net present cost (TNPC) of $103,267, significantly reducing CO2 emissions compared to traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses validate the optimized system’s adaptability and long-term viability across diverse operational scenarios, significantly advancing sustainable urban transport electrification strategies.}

abstract = {Inlet distortion significantly impacts the aeroelastic stability of aircraft engines, posing potential risks to their reliability and performance. Evaluating the probability of flutter in compressor blades is an effective approach to quantifying uncertain vibration characteristics and assessing blade aeroelastic stability. To improve modeling accuracy and computational efficiency in this analysis, a prediction method based on the sparrow search algorithm -deep extreme belief network (SSA-DEBN) model is proposed. The proposed method is evaluated through a case study involving the flutter probability assessment of a typical compressor rotor under inlet total pressure distortion. The results demonstrate that the aerodynamic modal damping ratio initially decreases and then increases as the wavelength of the inlet distortion decreases, reaching a minimum when the sinusoidal wave number of the distortion is two. Under inlet distortion conditions, the aerodynamic modal damping ratio of the compressor blade follows an approximate normal distribution, with a flutter reliability of 98.48 %. The primary factors influencing compressor blade flutter are rotational speed, inlet total temperature, vibration frequency, inlet total pressure, outlet static pressure, and distortion amplitude. The SSA-DEBN method has high accuracy and efficiency in the evaluation of compressor blade flutter failure mode by comparative analysis.}

Specifically, we use ChatGPT to analyse and interpret loan assessments written by loan officers and generate refined versions of these texts. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences between generative artificial intelligence (AI)-refined and human-written texts in terms of text length, semantic similarity, and linguistic representations. Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models’ prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT’s analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former. This study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of generative AI in financial services.}

With the growing demand for renewable energy, novel biomimetic humidity-sensitive (HS) actuators are gaining increasing attention from researchers due to their environmental friendliness, simple structure and wide range of actuating stimuli. These biomimetic hygroresponsive actuators are fundamentally structured as composite systems integrating a matrix phase for bulk material continuity and a reinforcement phase optimized for performance amplification. Within this framework, cellulose and agarose (AG)—as naturally derived biomaterials—are engineered as complementary hygroscopic phases—reinforcement and matrix respectively—exhibiting pronounced hygroactuation dynamics with a propensity for spontaneous bending under humidity-driven free energy gradients, quantified by the response/recovery speed (RS/Rec.S). This review, however, reveals through multidisciplinary analysis that these two materials exhibit intrinsic performance advantages in hygroactuator construction without functional coupling dependencies, while simultaneously demonstrating superior interfacial compatibility with diverse material systems. However, such potential remains largely underexplored, particularly regarding AG-based architectures, which poses significant challenges for large-scale commercial implementation. To optimize this protocol, this review establishes its theoretical foundation on representative studies, systematically analyzing the materials' prominent properties from fundamental principles in each chapter, introduces typical processing methods and characterization, and further demonstrates the prominence of each property. Additionally, the paper identifies underappreciated interdisciplinary insights through cross-domain analysis. Finally, Some applications of cellulose/AG-based actuators are given in this paper concisely, anticipates potential challenges in future development, and proposes green, feasible solutions to advance their practical application in humidity-driven technologies.}

The development of drivers-microcystin relationship is of vital importance to microcystin management. However, current practices often focused on the mean response of microcystin concentration and cannot meet the requirement of percentile-based compliance assessment. Despite of many informative studies on the development of drivers–microcystin relationship, there remains a gap between the relationship development and the percentile-based compliance assessment of microcystin concentration. In this study, Bayesian adaptive LASSO Tobit quantile regression (BALTQR) model was introduced to environmental and ecological studies for the first time. The model is specially designed for the prediction of left-censored response variable. We applied the BALTQR model to develop the drivers–microcystin relationship of lakes across the US continent. Based on the results of parameters estimation, Chlorophyll a (CHL), pH, and water temperature (WT) were identified as key drivers to the microcystin concentration. We found that CHL was approximate the same important as pH and both of them had positive effects on the microcystin concentration at all the five regression quantiles. WT was relatively less important and had a surprisingly negative effect at the 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 regression quantiles. We demonstrated that the BALTQR model successfully established the linkage between the development of drivers–microcystin relationship and the compliance assessment of microcystin concentration. We further revealed important implications of these findings to microcystin management. We believed that the BALTQR model has great potential of generalization to model other left-censored response variable in environmental and ecological studies.}

Despite extensive research, viable therapies remain elusive due to complex pathophysiology. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), shows promise in NDD diagnosis and treatment by leveraging vast datasets for accurate predictions. However, because AI models are “black boxes,” explainable AI (XAI) had to be created to make sure that physicians and patients would trust and accept it. Early detection is critical to stop degeneration and make things better for patients. Many in-depth studies on XAI are designed explicitly for NDDs. Existing research does not constantly look at how to interpret NDDs, how to evaluate them, or how to keep them safe. This paper fills in these gaps by looking at and grouping XAI methods for different NDDs, to make them easier to understand and use in medical settings. In this paper, we look at the interpretability methods used in various NDD studies. The methods are split into five groups based on the conditions they are used to treat: Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It organizes XAI methods into groups and talks about their pros, cons, and clinical importance. The study also finds some important research gaps. For example, it says that there are no good security frameworks and that XAI is hard to use in real-life healthcare settings. By giving helpful information and a plan for future research, this paper shows how XAI could change how NDDs are found, treated, and predicted. AI technologies will be used more in healthcare, and this will help us learn more about these challenging conditions.}

Grounded in qualitative findings from 27 participants in a healthcare setting, we propose a robust model that emphasizes the impact of AI–employee collaboration on AI mastery goal, user engagement, and a paradox mindset, as well as the moderating role of AI empathy and technological frames. Using a quantitative method, we collected data from 452 participants in a healthcare setting across two studies. Our findings showed that AI–employee collaboration can drive AI mastery goal and a paradox mindset. We also found empirical evidence that both AI mastery goal and the paradox mindset can mediate the relationship between employee–AI collaboration and user engagement. Moreover, our findings revealed interesting moderating results across two studies. In Study 1, significant effects were found for both employee–AI collaboration and AI mastery goal at low AI empathy, but not at high levels. In Study 2, while the interaction between employee–AI collaboration and AI empathy was not significant, the influence of AI mastery goal became significant at high empathy levels, and the paradox mindset showed a significant effect only at high levels of AI empathy. These findings provide managers with valuable insights into the essential operations dynamic of employee–AI collaboration, underscoring its important role in enhancing user engagement.}

Based on data from N = 1047 students in Grade 7 (n = 613) and Grade 10 (n = 434), we examined whether the unskilled and unaware effect exists with regard to high school students’ political knowledge, whether the effect is different in Grade 7 and Grade 10, and how teachers’ behavior (i.e., cognitively activating and motivating teaching) affects students’ judgement accuracy and judgement direction. The results show that the unskilled and unaware effect exists in both grade levels. Furthermore, visual and statistical examination of the data suggest that the pattern of data is very similar in both grade levels. Finally, we further find that perceived motivational quality is associated with judgement accuracy, but also with overconfidence. Perceived cognitive activation is negatively associated with judgement accuracy. Through the usage of two-cohort data, this study applies a novel approach and bears important implications for research on the unskilled and unaware effect. Furthermore, the results regarding the teachers’ behavior provide important insights for educational practice in civic education.}

There is increasing recognition that human-like agents might be natural human collaborators. However, there has been limited work on designing agents according to the principles of human cognition or in empirically testing their teamwork effectiveness. In this study, we introduce the Team Defense Game (TDG), a novel experimental platform for investigating human-autonomy teaming in cyber defense scenarios. We design an agent that relies on episodic memory to determine its actions (Cognitive agent) and compare its effectiveness with two types of autonomous agents: one that relies on heuristic reasoning (Heuristic agent) and one that behaves randomly (Random agent). These agents are compared in a human-autonomy team (HAT) performing a cyber-protection task in the TDG. We systematically evaluate how autonomous teammates’ abilities and competence impact the team’s interaction and outcomes. The results revealed that teams with Cognitive agents are the most effective partners, followed by teams with Heuristic and Random agents. Evaluation of collaborative team process metrics suggests that the cognitive agent is more adaptive to individual play styles of human teammates, but it is also inconsistent and less predictable than the Heuristic agent. Competent agents (Cognitive and Heuristic agents) require less human effort but might cause over-reliance. A post-experiment questionnaire showed that competent agents are rated more trustworthy and cooperative than Random agents. We also found that human participants’ subjective ratings correlate with their team performance, and humans tend to take the credit or responsibility for the team. Our work advances HAT research by providing empirical evidence of how the design of different autonomous agents (cognitive, heuristic, and random) affect team performance and dynamics in cybersecurity contexts. We propose that autonomous agents for HATs should possess both competence and human-like cognition while also ensuring predictable behavior or clear explanations to maintain human trust. Additionally, they should proactively seek human input to enhance teamwork effectiveness.}

abstract = {Vishing – the use of voice calls for phishing – is a form of Social Engineering (SE) attacks. The latter have become a pervasive challenge in modern societies, with over 300,000 yearly victims in the US alone. An increasing number of those attacks is conducted via voice communication, be it through machine-generated ‘robocalls’ or human actors. The goals of ‘social engineers’ can be manifold, from outright fraud to more subtle forms of persuasion. Accordingly, social engineers adopt multi-faceted strategies for voice-based attacks, utilising a variety of ‘tricks’ to exert influence and achieve their goals. Importantly, while organisations have set in place a series of guardrails against other types of SE attacks, voice calls still remain ‘open ground’ for potential bad actors. In the present contribution, we provide an overview of the existing speech technology subfields that need to coalesce into a protective net against one of the major challenges to societies worldwide. Given the dearth of speech science and technology works targeting this issue, we have opted for a narrative review that bridges the gap between the existing psychological literature on the topic and research that has been pursued in parallel by the speech community on some of the constituent constructs. Our review reveals that very little literature exists on addressing this very important topic from a speech technology perspective, an omission further exacerbated by the lack of available data. Thus, our main goal is to highlight this gap and sketch out a roadmap to mitigate it, beginning with the psychological underpinnings of vishing, which primarily include deception and persuasion strategies, continuing with the speech-based approaches that can be used to detect those, as well as the generation and detection of AI-based vishing attempts, and close with a discussion of ethical and legal considerations.}

The purpose of this paper is to solve the heterogeneous multi-attribute group decision making (HMAGDM) problems with attribute values involving real numbers, intervals, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets from the perspective that alternatives have regret psychology with respect to the assessment information and that there is a non-cooperative competitive relationship among alternatives. Therefore a method based on regret theory and interval data envelopment analysis (DEA) game cross-efficiency model is proposed for HMAGDM. The method adopts a process of aggregation followed by exploration. In the aggregation phase, a regret theory-based expert weight determination model is constructed to derive the weights of experts, and the individual decision matrices provided by individual experts are further aggregated into a collective decision matrix. Then, the heterogeneous information in the collective decision matrix is uniformly converted into intervals, which are represented as variables with unknown parameters. According to these variables, a regret theory-based interval DEA game cross-efficiency model is proposed to calculate the comprehensive values of alternatives and thus rank alternatives. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated by a supplier selection example.}

We study how conflict between the goals of profit maximisation and customer satisfaction determines decision making in the newsvendor problem. The paper consists of three studies which explore conflict from different positions. In Study 1 we show that stockouts cause newsvendor subjects to increase their stocking levels, whereas this effect is absent in a neutrally framed version of the same problem. Conflict is reflected in longer response times under low profit margin, where there is an increased likelihood of ex-post conflict, than under high profit margin. We also find that some subjects are more concerned than others of nonpecuniary factors, and this affects their decision making. In Study 2 we show that an endogenous conflict manipulation affects newsvendor behaviour. We theorise that broad bracketing (reappraisal of the choice situation) should decrease conflict, for which we find some evidence, but we also find that subjects decide less optimally when they use broad bracketing than when they use narrow bracketing. In Study 3 we use a binary newsvendor problem and model the decision process of the newsvendor using the diffusion decision model. The results show that, as in Study 1, the profit margin environment affects how newsvendors respond to conflict. Furthermore, the relative decision evidence towards the optimal choice accumulates at a slower rate after there has been a stockout. Our findings highlight that understanding decision biases in operations should include non-monetary goals, such as avoiding stockouts.}

Computational and empirical work has attempted to identify the specific neural mechanisms and cognitive processes that allow us to reliably produce speech sounds. This work has established that humans can use their perception of the auditory and somatosensory consequences of their actions to guide subsequent speech movements. However, speech predominantly takes place in a communicative context, and this context is also known to modulate the way that people speak: human voices are highly flexible. In this paper, we try to unite the traditional motor control conception of internally defined acoustic and somatosensory goals with linguistic research showing that talkers respond and entrain to their conversational partners. We provide an overview of the theoretical and empirical work surrounding the use of sensory feedback monitoring in speech production and discuss practical constraints that have limited more naturalistic investigations into dyadic interaction. To conclude, we argue that the variability of results seen in the speech motor control literature reflects a more complex underlying neural architecture, and an overarching communicative goal that supersedes specific phonetic targets.}

The use of Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels in construction is often constrained by their weight, making handling and installation challenging. These limitations frequently result in on-site planning and manual assembly, increasing risks and inefficiencies. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM), discrete event simulation, and robotic assembly to optimize the installation of CLT structures within the built environment. By leveraging these technologies, the methodology addresses material handling challenges while enhancing construction efficiency and adaptability to urban and prefabricated settings. Numerical simulations and robotic assembly experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the framework’s performance. Results demonstrate an improvement in assembly efficiency, reducing both accident risks and installation time compared to manual methods. Strong agreement between numerical and experimental findings underscores the potential of computational tools in advancing automated construction practices. This research provides actionable recommendations to promote the broader adoption of automated processes in CLT construction, contributing to safer, more efficient, and sustainable building practices within the evolving built environment.}

Using patent data from China's high-tech manufacturing sector (2014–2023), the study finds an inverted U-shaped relationship between Digital Disruptive Events (DDE) and Green Innovation (GI). The network structure of knowledge and collaboration plays varying moderating roles in this relationship. Structural holes in a firm's knowledge network negatively moderate the effect of DDE on GI, while degree centrality shows no significant moderation. Conversely, more structural holes and lower degree centrality in collaboration networks positively influence GI. The findings highlight the importance of leveraging multilayered network structures to drive green innovation during digital transformation.}

Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology has emerged as an effective tool in recent years, which can provide direct insight into designers’ cognitive processes and intentions. However, the current application of EEG technology in engineering design faces difficulties in adapting to multi-task scenarios and rarely targets the design process directly. This study proposed a design intention recognition approach based on Vision Transformer (ViT) and EEG data applicable to multiple engineering design tasks. An image-like representation matrix is introduced to organize designers’ EEG data with the retention of its spatial and frequency features. Then, standard EEG data under different design intentions as well as the EEG data from real design processes is utilized to train and fine-tune a ViT-based design intention recognition model. An experiment workflow for collecting the two types of EEG data is also presented, along with detailed examples of three design tasks. The comparative experiment results and the case study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed design intention recognition approach.}

abstract = {Interest in urban gentrification has grown in recent years due to changes in urban neighborhoods. Using a meta-synthesis approach, this study offers a thorough analysis of datasets and papers pertaining to machine learning applications in gentrification studies from 1979 to 2024. This rigorous meta-synthesis, following a systematic review, screened 217 initial articles, refined to 83 through multi-stage screening including duplicate removal (185), title/abstract (156), and full-text review. By means of this analysis, the study clarifies several facets of gentrification from three main angles: important causes, spatial effects, and algorithmic applications. A strong conceptual framework that takes into account the connections between important indicators is offered, offering a comprehensive comprehension of the phenomenon. The results demonstrate how machine learning may be used to predict future events and spot gentrification patterns. Three main axes drive this predictive capability: first, supervised learning models that use social, economic, environmental, and physical-spatial indicators to predict gentrification; second, unsupervised learning methods that find similar neighborhoods and uncover underlying patterns; and third, hybrid learning methods that combine both supervised and unsupervised approaches (such as semi-supervised learning and ensemble methods) to leverage their complementary strengths in handling multidimensional urban data and enhancing prediction robustness. These advancements enable more in-depth analyses of urban dynamics and a deeper comprehension of the complexities of gentrification. This study provides policymakers with a foundation for developing workable strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of gentrification and advance sustainable urban growth. Furthermore, by identifying research gaps and suggesting possible avenues for future work, the study broadens the scope of the subject and contributes to the development of new ideas and empirical research on urban gentrification. This in-depth examination highlights how crucial machine learning is to understanding and managing urban change, as well as how it may promote evidence-based planning and equitable urban growth.}

abstract = {Calibration is, and will remain, an integral component of radio interferometric data reduction. However, as larger, more sensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration problem grows in both size and difficulty. The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales quadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new instruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their predecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more challenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images) which would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic range and, ultimately, the derived science. It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package implementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves upon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance. Whilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger derivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary length chains of parameterized gain terms. QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to express calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs can (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware configurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer hardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster. QuartiCal’s qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations of PSR J2009-2026. These qualitative results are followed by an analysis of QuartiCal’s performance in terms of wall time and memory footprint for a number of calibration scenarios and hardware configurations.}

With the rapid development of e-commerce industry, precision marketing has become a key means for enterprises to enhance competitiveness and profitability. However, traditional marketing methods often cannot accurately identify the characteristics of customers, leading to the waste of e-commerce resources. In this context, e-commerce enterprises urgently need a more accurate and efficient marketing method to meet the growing business needs. To this end, this study attempts to optimize the traditional K-means algorithm, and fundamentally improve the clustering effect in precision marketing by optimizing the selection of initial clustering centers and similarity measurement methods. Based on this, the research constructs an e-commerce marketing system based on HC-means algorithm to more accurately divide customer groups, identify high-value customers, potential customers and lost customers, and formulate differentiated marketing strategies for different groups. Experiments show that the average accuracy of HC-means algorithm in Glass database is 93.71, which is 15.48-15.79 higher than the highest accuracy of other two kinds of algorithms in the same kind of database. When the cluster number is 8, the Mahalanobis distance of HC-Means is reduced by 2.1 and 1.2 respectively compared with K-means and DBSCAN, which indicates that the clustering results are more reasonable in data distribution. When the cluster number is 3, more than half of the customers' consumption interval days are mainly concentrated between 8-12 days, and about 10% of the customers make purchases every 2 days. These accurate customer behavior insights provide a strong basis for marketing strategy development. To sum up, the HC-Means system constructed by the research has achieved remarkable results in e-commerce precision marketing, greatly improving user satisfaction, and providing a valuable reference scheme for e-commerce enterprises to optimize marketing mode and achieve sustainable development.}

The debate persists on whether language and thought are distinct entities or if language is deeply embedded in individual cognitive processes. This study employs adjective cues combined with a mental imagery size judgment task as an experimental paradigm, utilizing neurophysiological techniques to preliminarily explore the role of adjectives in size judgment tasks and their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Findings reveal that performance is best when adjectives are congruent with the size of the object, with EEG microstate results indicating strong activity in Class A, related to language networks under this condition. Additionally, when adjectives conflict with object size, the discovery of the Ni component suggests that individuals monitor and inhibit the conflict between adjectives and object size, leading to decreased task performance in this condition. Moreover, when object size is ambiguous, individuals' size judgments do not benefit significantly from clear adjective cues. Event-related potentials and EEG microstate results suggest that under this condition, top-down cognitive resources are recruited more extensively. In conclusion, language plays a more crucial role in simpler judgment tasks; as tasks become more complex, judgment processes engage a greater number of distributed brain regions to collaborate, while the language system remains active. This study provides initial cognitive neuroscience evidence for understanding the relationship between language and simple forms of thought, offering preliminary insights for future investigations into the connection between language and thought.}

Through a combination of static gelation experiments and core flow experiments, the thickening performance and seepage characteristics in porous media of the novel HDS system was studied. Considering the viscosity changes and dynamic chain extension reactions of the HDS system, the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) micro-continuum approach was applied to develop a multi-physical mathematical model for the migration of HDS system in a pore-throat network. Therefore, a 4-meter core experiment and multi-scale numerical modeling were conducted to analyze the dynamic chain extension efficiency and spatial distribution characteristics of the HDS system. Additionally, machine learning techniques were used to define the dynamic chain extension reaction index (RI) and identify its critical threshold, exploring the effects of varying injection parameters, solution concentrations, and permeabilities on the chain extension behavior. Results show that HDS molecular chains form aggregated structures that evolve into a unique spatial network. As the network structure becomes denser, the viscosity of HDS system increases rapidly. As the core permeability increases, the core throat size enlarges, and the compatibility between the HDS system molecular aggregates and the pore throat improves. HDS system shows good transmission performance during migration in the long core. Numerical simulations and machine learning techniques were employed to define the dynamic chain extension RI, examining how RI changes under varying injection parameters, solution concentrations, and permeabilities. As permeability, HDS system concentration, and injection rate increase, the RI also increases. The results are presented in the RI graph, offering theoretical insights for deep profile adjustment and the development of reagent systems.}

A steady-state ARS model was established using Simulink to comprehensively analyze the impacts of parameters including heat source water, cooling water, and chilled water on the system's coefficient of performance (COP). The investigation revealed that elevated heat source water temperatures significantly enhance refrigeration performance, while increased cooling water temperatures cause synchronous reductions in both cooling capacity and COP. Chilled water flow rate variations demonstrate negligible effects on COP. Furthermore, an ARS laboratory test platform was constructed and validated through indoor experiments, incorporating environmental parameters from an ongoing high geothermal tunnel project and numerical simulation results. The findings demonstrate excellent agreement between computational predictions and experimental data, confirming the robust adaptability of the designed ARS under the specific tunnel conditions. In summary, this research establishes a theoretical foundation for resourceful utilization of high geothermal heat hazards, contributing to green construction practices and sustainable development in tunneling engineering.}

The density and details of how the acetylenic links are distributed allow for a variety of electronic signatures. Here we propose a graphyne system based on the recently synthesized biphenylene monolayer. We demonstrate that this system features highly localized states with a spin-polarized semiconducting configuration.

In the first part of the article, some Lyapunov-like sufficient conditions are derived to stabilize an impulsive system within the prescribed-time, where impulsive instants are obtained through an event-triggered mechanism. Unlike event-triggered control, event-triggered impulsive control executes solely when the event is generated. The second part of the article provides sufficient Lyapunov-like criteria for the prescribed-time stability of impulsive systems via a self-triggered mechanism. Contrary to the event-triggered impulsive control, where triggering instants are obtained through continuous or periodic monitoring of the event-triggering conditions, the proposed self-triggered impulsive control strategy can estimate the next triggering instant by the information available in the currently triggered instant. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from both of the proposed mechanisms.

Traditional signal coordination methods face challenges in ensuring efficient traffic flow on long arterials due to urban expansion and complex spatiotemporal variations. However, existing methods struggle to achieve effective signal coordination under complex spatiotemporal variations, and lack methodological framework for universally applicable green wave coordination. To address this, a spatiotemporal partitioning-based green wave trajectory feature coordination optimization model is proposed. First, temporal partitioning is performed using an improved Fisher optimal segmentation method, while spatial subarea division is achieved via an enhanced K-Medoids algorithm. For each subarea, an arterial traffic signal control model is established based on green wave trajectory characteristics. Phase difference coordination equations are then applied to synchronize adjacent subareas. The model is validated on Foshan’s Lvjing Road, with evening peak performance compared against a classical green wave trajectory approach. Results indicate that the proposed model reduces vehicle average delay by 13.18% and the number of stops by 18.05%.}

abstract = {Background
Cognitive impairment is a prominent feature in the clinical presentation of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with MDD have brain structural and functional abnormalities. However, the association between such abnormalities and cognitive function remains unclear.
Methods
For this research, 105 patients with treatment-naïve first-episode MDD and 53 healthy controls (HCs) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessment. The MRI main indicators included sulcus depth (SD), local gyration index (LGI) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) was used for neuropsychological assessment. The support vector machine (SVM) was used to assess the accuracy of the classification.
Results
Compared with the HCs, the patients with MDD had significant decreases in five dimensions of the MCCB, as well as in SD in the left superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal cortex, but had an increases in LGI in the left precuneus cortex and pericalcarine cortex and ALFF of the left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. In addition, the visual learning score (one MCCB dimension) was negatively associated with the SD of the left superior temporal sulcus and positively associated with the ALFF of left calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. The SVM has a relatively good ability to distinguish patients with MDD and HCs.
Conclusion
Cognitive impairment in patients with MDD was associated with abnormal an SD and ALFF. These findings help to further understand cognitive impairment in patients with MDD.}

abstract = {The increasing pressure to ensure product safety in a global market comes up against the current practice of targeting only known hazardous compounds in product safety analysis. However, product safety refers not only to known but also to unknown or hidden hazards that are very important to know and avoid. Shortcomings and limitations of currently used technologies seem to cause an obvious discrepancy between intended and actual consumer protection. Products are not as safe as claimed by stakeholders. An existing but overlooked proactive safety screening with a prioritization strategy is brought into focus as it offers a unique solution. It can handle the complexity of a product with thousands of compounds of unknown identity and unknown toxicity and can figure out the important hazardous compounds, both known and unknown. Using hardly any sample preparation and the effect detection at an early position in the workflow is a game changer not to overlook hazardous compounds. All analytical technologies are needed, but the key is the re-arrangement of the instrument order, i.e. firstly hazard-related screening (effect first) and secondly, focus on identification of prioritized hazardous compounds. Such a proactive safety screening revealed previously unknown hazardous compounds in products on the market claimed to be safe. The highly sustainable, affordable, and all-in-one 2LabsToGo-Eco with easy-to-use planar bioassays empowers stakeholders to implement proactive safety screening and dynamic risk management. The transition to greater efficacy in consumer protection needs incentives and the critical review aims to stimulate a debate.}

This framework, rooted in historical philosophical distinctions between qualities, gave rise to the ‘binding problem’: how the brain integrates these separately processed features into coherent percepts. We present converging evidence from electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and lesion studies that challenges this framework. We argue that the binding problem may be an artifact of theoretical assumptions rather than a real computational challenge for the brain. Drawing insights from deep neural networks (DNNs) and recent empirical findings, we propose a framework where the visual cortex represents naturally co-occurring patterns of information rather than processing isolated features that need binding.}

Traditional measures often link reliance to decision-making outcomes, which may not be suitable for complex problem-solving tasks where outcomes are not binary (i.e., correct or incorrect) or immediately clear. Therefore, this study aims to develop a scale to measure undergraduate students’ behaviors of using Generative AI during problem-solving tasks without directly linking them to specific outcomes. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on 800 responses collected after students finished one problem-solving activity, which revealed four distinct factors: reflective use, cautious use, thoughtless use, and collaborative use. The overall scale has reached sufficient internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .84). Two confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to validate the factors using the remaining 730 responses from this activity and 1,173 responses from another problem-solving activity. CFA indices showed adequate model fit for data from both problem-solving tasks, suggesting that the scale can be applied to various human-AI problem-solving tasks. This study offers a validated scale to measure students’ reliance behaviors in different human-AI problem-solving activities and provides implications for educators to responsively integrate Generative AI in higher education.}

Traditional product design processes often struggle to accurately capture complex user needs and generate market-relevant solutions due to a heavy reliance on subjective human input and limited decision support tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in various domains, their application in product design remains limited, often resulting in generic outputs. To address this, we propose an innovative paradigm for intelligent product design generation, termed ProdGen. The core of ProdGen is the ProdGen-Agent system, which integrates LLMs with customized expert design tools, leveraging the proposed Multi-Design Task Adapter (MDT-A) method and a Dual Knowledge Enhancement Mechanism. The MDT-A method injects multimodal design task knowledge into LLMs through a unified knowledge fusion framework, enabling enhanced task decomposition and efficient interaction with custom design tools. The Dual Knowledge Enhancement Mechanism enriches LLM performance by incorporating domain-specific knowledge bases and structured graph-based data retrieval, ensuring more accurate and relevant design outputs. Demonstrated through kitchen design cases, ProdGen-Agent autonomously handles the entire design process, excelling in user need analysis, task breakdown, decision-making support, tool integration, and multidimensional design generation. Expert evaluations validate ProdGen-Agent’s effectiveness in automating complex design tasks, confirming its potential to revolutionize product design processes across various industries by leveraging LLMs in combination with domain expertise.}

In particular, parrots and corvids, clades known for cognitive abilities that match those of primates, have brains that contain more pallial than cerebellar neurons. Birds and mammals may thus have followed different evolutionary routes of pallial–cerebellar coordination behind enhanced cognitive complexity.}

Presently, we introduce several effective methods to improve BU results for a lesser compatible formulation for which we had thus far been unable to prepare to acceptable levels of homogeneity to meet AV specification criteria. Simple, practical strategies for overcoming BU issues are proposed assessing a range of techniques, with results demonstrating a powerful potential for RAM performance to be improved upon through only small adjustments to initial sample conditions. Several anomalous results and behavior are reported which have eluded mechanistic understanding through conventional means. In the course of pursuing a unified theory capable of correct mechanistic interpretations of RAM results, a fresh perspective is offered from a refined theoretical development of RAM-specific principles, and mechanisms such as vibrational forcing and exponential amplification are proposed. By investigating the roles of RAM operational mechanics and fundamental acoustic principles, satisfactory explanations can begin to be obtained. By considering these facets to RAM mixing processes, microscale mixing potential was increased by a factor of 4x and allowed for homogeneity to be established at 150 μg using a semi-fine CAF sample and extend to levels down to at least 32.5 μg.}

As an important part of the switchgear, basin-type insulators will seriously affect the reliability and safety of the switchgear operation in case of failure such as breakage or partial discharge. There are still many limitations in the current risk assessment methods for basin-type insulators, resulting in inaccurate risk identification and classification. Therefore, this paper proposes an extended failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) based on the defects of traditional FMEA model based on regret theory(RT), group satisfaction index and the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method to assess the failure mode of basin-type insulators. First, the expert applies the 5Why analysis to obtain the failure modes of basin-type insulators. Then the risk assessment information given by the experts in uncertain linguistic terms (ULT) is assembled by probabilistic uncertain linguistic terms sets (PULTSs). Secondly, in order to improve the accuracy of the expert group information during the calculation, this paper proposes a new group satisfaction index for describing the degree of satisfaction and disagreement of expert opinions, and constructs a PUL-MEREC-SWARA integrated weight acquisition method based on this index for determining the weights of risk factors. Finally, in order to improve the accuracy and stability of the ranking, a new PUL-RT-CoCoSo integrated decision framework is proposed to rank the importance of failure modes in a more rational way. The stability, validity and superiority of the proposed model are demonstrated through the sensitivity analysis of parameters and comparison with several typical ranking methods.}

Communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity are 21st-century skills required to be developed in educational settings from an early age. Robotics seems to contribute to that. Therefore, this study focuses on kindergarten and explores the current research trends regarding children's development of these skills via robotics. It aims to a) construct links between the main factors in the existing research, b) map the related field, and identify gaps to enhance our understanding. In this context, a bibliometric analysis using the Bibliometrix package and CiteSpace and a content analysis utilizing the Atlas.ti Software is employed covering 203 of 3822 studies conducted between 2014 and December 2024. Based on the findings, the most frequently examined topics are social-anthropomorphic robots, human-robot interaction, and computational thinking under the umbrella of educational robotics and skills development. The highest publication performance belongs to the USA, Italy, Japan, China, and Greece. The strongest sources are ACM, IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, the Education and Information Technologies Journal, the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, and the Computers and Education Journal. Besides, Papert, Wing, and Bers arise as the most influential authors. Furthermore, most studies explore one or two C-skills, examining critical thinking the most and creativity the least during interventions focused on several domains but rarely on skills promotion. Moreover, most researchers choose the qualitative method, using small sample sizes, wheeled, floor robots, and various learning theories in short-term interventions. Finally, robots are utilized as assistive instruction kits, teammates, and educators’ assistants while children act as researchers-constructors.}

This approach considers various indicators, including cost, environmental impact, and societal factors when designing bridges. This shift enables a comprehensive assessment of structural resilience by examining the bridge's ability to endure various hazards throughout its lifespan. This study provides a comprehensive review of two key research domains that have emerged in the field of bridge life-cycle analysis, namely life-cycle sustainability (LCS) and life-cycle performance (LCP). The discussion on the LCS of bridges encompasses both assessment-based and optimization-based studies, while the exploration of LCP focuses on research examining structures subjected to deterioration over their service life due to deprecating phenomena such as corrosion and relative humidity changes, as well as extreme hazards like earthquakes and floods. Moreover, this study discusses the integration between LCS and LCP, highlighting how combined consideration of these factors can minimize damage costs, improve resiliency, and extend the lifespan of the structure. A detailed evaluation encompasses various life-cycle metrics, structural performance indicators, time-dependent modelling techniques, and analysis methods proposed in the literature. Additionally, the research identifies critical gaps and trends in life-cycle analysis within the realm of bridge engineering, providing a concise yet thorough overview for advancing considerations in the life-cycle design of bridges.}

Under pathological states, however, this control can extend to non-threatening scenarios. For example, pathological states of aversive memory involve fear-overgeneralization in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders. Furthermore, negative bias in cognitive processing and memory formation is seen in depressed individuals displaying enhanced encoding and recall, less forgetting or repetition of negative memory (rumination) as well as impaired recall of positive memory. Beyond pathological conditions, researchers have long aimed to understand the basic biological entity of memory. This unit termed “engram” is the cellular and molecular component of enduring physiological changes in the brain, enabling learning and memory retrieval. Herein, the hippocampus is central in the formation of context-dependent episodic memories and therefore most often studied in animal experiments to elucidate complex memory traces. In addition, the hippocampus is critically involved in fear-circuits and stress-related dysfunction. This review summarizes current knowledge about memory engrams in hippocampal (sub)regions and their functional relevance regarding neuronal correlates and rodent behavior. A special focus is placed on the negative valence of a memory and the formation of engrams for aversive memories, specifically induced by fear or stress. Finally, limitations of current engram research and possible future directions to improve our understanding of negatively valued memory and its implications in neuropathological conditions will be discussed.}

To address this gap, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis comprising 80 creativity experiments (1,850 subjects) and 23 exploration experiments (646 subjects) to examine potential shared neural activations between creativity and exploration. Furthermore, we analyzed the neural similarities and differences among three forms of creative thinking—divergent thinking (DT), convergent thinking (CT), and artistic creativity—and their relationship with exploration. The conjunction analysis of creativity and exploration revealed significant activations in the bilateral IFJ and left preSMA. Further conjunction analyses revealed that both CT and artistic creativity exhibited common neural activations with exploration, with CT co-activating the left IFJ and artistic creativity co-activating both the right IFJ and left preSMA, while DT did not. Additionally, the conjunction analyses across the three forms of creativity did not identify shared neural activations. Further functional decoding analyses of the overlapping brain regions associated with CT and exploration, as well as artistic creativity and exploration, revealed correlations with inhibitory control mechanisms. These results enhance our understanding of the role of exploration in the creative thinking process and provide valuable insights for developing strategies to foster innovative thinking.}

Previous research shows that many people who have experienced flooding exhibit a greater preparedness to act on climate change, especially when the experience relates to more pronounced emotional responses. However, this research has mainly focused on general negative emotional reactions to flooding. Here, we re-analysed a large UK survey dataset (N = 1997) using mixed-methods to examine discrete emotional responses to flooding, including positive emotions, and their relationship with environmental intentions and policy support. Whilst anxiety, anger, helplessness, and distress, dominate people’s experience, positive emotions were also reported as significantly higher in our flooded group, particularly gratitude and pride in response to the receipt of external and community support; surprise was also observed. Thematic analysis highlighted perceived impacts of flooding, and the experience of positive support, as being key to alleviating distress and anxiety, as well as promoting subsequent positive long-term actions to reduce flooding. Notably indirect experience of flooding was also impactful with a range of emotional responses also reported by observers. Regression analysis indicated that higher levels of anxiety, distress, and gratitude were associated with greater intentions to act environmentally in the future (alongside greater levels of anger and lower levels of indifference), and to support for environmental policies (alongside greater levels of sympathy). We suggest that the provision of support following flooding may promote considerations of morality and climate change and increase the likelihood (of both recipients and observers) to undertake pro social and pro-environmental behaviour themselves in the future.}

Many cancers overexpress low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), facilitating cholesterol metabolism for tumour growth. Targeting LDLR offers a promising strategy for selective drug delivery. Orlistat, a fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, has shown anti-cancer potential, particularly in tumours with high FAS expression. This study introduces an LDLR-Orlistat Targeted Nanoparticles (LDLR-OTNs) to enhance cancer cell uptake via LDLR-mediated endocytosis. The objectives include synthesizing lipid-based orlistat nanoparticles, functionalizing them with an 11-mer LDLR-binding peptide, assessing uptake and cytotoxicity in three LDLR- and FAS-expressing breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, MDA MB 453, MCF-7), and comparing uptake kinetics with non-targeted nanoparticles.

Orlistat nanoparticles (ONs) were synthesised via rapid solvent exchange, producing uncoated ONs, POPC-coated ONs (POPC-ONs), and LDLR-targeted ONs (LDLR-OTNs). Targeting was achieved by conjugating an 11-mer binding peptide (RLTRKRGLKLA) to DSPE-PEG5000 maleimide via click chemistry, confirmed by Ellman’s test. Nanoparticles were characterised using DLS and TEM. Cellular uptake over 24 hours was assessed using fluorescence-labelled POPC-ONs and LDLR-OTNs, and uptake kinetics were analysed. Suramin-blocking studies were used to confirm LDLR-mediated uptake. A 48-hour cytotoxicity assay quantified IC50 values in the aforementioned cell lines.
Results
TEM data showed that LDLR-OTNs (33 nm) were smaller than untargeted POPC-ONs (58 nm) and uncoated ONs (67 nm). Ellman’s test confirmed > 99.2% peptide conjugation. Cellular uptake of LDLR-OTNs was rapid, with significant fluorescence by 1 hour and a kinetic plateau at 24–48 hours, with data fitting to a modified exponential model, while that of untargeted POPC-ONs had lower initial uptake, following a logistic model. Suramin blocking reduced LDLR-OTN uptake, confirming receptor-mediated entry. Cytotoxicity assays yielded IC50 values of 23.8 µM (BT-474), 25.8 µM (MDA MB 453), and 8.2 µM (MCF-7), with maximal inhibition at 48 h.
Conclusions
LDLR-OTNs demonstrated receptor-mediated uptake and potent cytotoxicity in LDLR- and FAS- overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings support LDLR-targeted nanoparticles as a promising approach for delivering FAS inhibitors to LDLR-rich tumours, meriting further investigation in targeted cancer therapy development.}

However, the complexity of AI ethics makes it hard to pin down what to teach, how to teach it, and how to assess its effectiveness. Drawing on an educational perspective, this paper presents a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of the early years of AI ethics education as a formalized field to analyze whether its future trajectory is aligned with educational best practices. Our review highlights core challenges in AI ethics education and the content, assessment, and pedagogy used in real interventions over recent years. We find that efforts to teach AI ethics do helpfully draw on a holistic view (as opposed to a narrow view), and utilize progressive pedagogies like case studies and group projects that aim to meaningfully challenge students’ ethical reasoning skills in applied practices. However, many real- world AI ethics teaching interventions do not leverage well-supported assessment techniques known to support student learning; rather, assessment is conducted primarily for research evaluative purposes. This gap in rigorous assessment raises implications for researchers and practitioners, as responsible development and use of AI will be stymied if educators cannot successfully determine whether students have truly learned relevant AI ethics content or skills.}

abstract = {In daily life, individuals are influenced by the behaviors of others. The question of how far-reaching this social influence extends to travel behaviors has received significant attention in recent decades, through the capture of dyadic interaction effects that may exist among individuals. Along these lines, in the current study, we apply a Spatial-Attitudinal Probit Model (SAPM) that assumes an autoregressive lag structure in the utilities underlying individuals’ travel mode choice, specifically focusing on the choice between car and public transportation for commuting trips. Notably, the magnitude of interdependency among decision agents is measured by a global weight matrix, accounting for a dual source of influence: (1) spatial proximity, measured as the Euclidean distance between individuals’ residential locations, and (2) attitudinal similarities, specifically perceptions regarding sustainable mobility and environmental awareness. To our knowledge, this represents the first application of an autoregressive travel mode choice model accounting for both geographical and attitudinal proximity as simultaneous sources of interaction. The dataset for our analysis includes 2,347 observations, corresponding to the one-way commute trips of 2,347 individuals, as reported during a survey conducted between October 2019 and January 2020 in the metropolitan area of Cagliari, Italy. Our results reveal the significant role of social autoregressive parameters and the presence of interdependency effects among individuals’ commute mode choices. The utilization of a social lag structure allows for the separate identification of direct and indirect effects of explanatory variables. Notably, around 40% of the total effect is attributed to the indirect effects arising from individuals’ social interdependencies. This finding holds important implications for evaluating and planning potential future measures aimed at increasing public transit usage.}

In this study, we explored brain structural correlates (e.g., in cortical thickness (CT) and gray matter (GM) volume) of authoritarianism. For this purpose, we assessed authoritarian dispositions in a sample of 100 young adults and collected 3 T MR images. Images were computed using the CAT12 toolbox. Behaviorally, both the LWA and RWA were positively associated with negative urgency; the LWA also showed a robust positive association with trait anxiety. At the neural level, results showed a negative correlation (r = -0.48) between RWA and a GM volume cluster located in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). In addition, we also observed a negative correlation (r = -0.41) between the LWA anti-hierarchical aggression subscale and a CT cluster located in the right anterior insula. Additionally, the resulting clusters converged with further left-wing and right-wing ideology scales related to LWA and RWA, thus providing a robustness check. These results are supported by previous studies showing the relevance of the dmPFC and the anterior insula on social cognition and empathy/inhibitory control, respectively.}

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to shine light on fundamental statistical concepts that archaeologists do not talk about enough. I argue that more deliberate discussion of these statistical ‘elephants in the room’ can have a positive impact on improving statistical training and on steering us away from perpetuation of poor research practices. 1) Statistical thinking should come first. This will help us break down some of the stigma around numbers and statistics, and set us up for building analytical frameworks that will provide the most informative answers to our research questions. 2) Descriptive and inferential statistics have different interpretative potential. This will clarify how we can move from using tools that only allow us to talk about our studied samples to using tools that enable us to draw inferences about the underlying populations from which the samples derived. 3) p values can be extremely variable. This will help spread awareness about the misuses and misconceptions of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and demonstrate the dangers of using significance thresholds to interpret data. 4) Statistical precision is not the same as measurement precision. This will bring attention to the many different types of uncertainties that are built into archaeological datasets (e.g., statistical precision, instrument measurement error, natural variation),.Recognising this is key for drawing reliable inferences from our data. 5) Meta-analyses and forest plots can be useful for synthesising previous research. This will help spread awareness about the benefit of meta-analyses for creating evidence-driven summaries of previous findings. The discussion draws on examples from isotope archaeology, bioarchaeology, and organic residue analysis to illustrate how switching from a reliance on significance testing to a reliance on effect sizes can improve methodological rigour and the representativeness of our findings. The paper ends with a discussion of the roles and responsibilities of supervisors for creating an effective learning environment for statistical training. This includes, but is not limited to, acknowledging the problems of NHST and advocating for adherence to Open Science principles. Ultimately, the changes suggested in this paper will help us raise discipline-wide standards for quantitative training and improve both the breadth and the depth of archaeological research.}

While existing evaluation studies primarily focus on unimodal (vision-only) comprehension and reasoning capabilities, they overlook critical assessments of complex multimodal reasoning tasks that require integrated understanding of both visual and textual contexts. Such multimodal tasks present unique challenges, demanding sophisticated reasoning across multiple modalities and deep comprehension of multimodal contexts. In this paper, we present MM-InstructEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that incorporates diverse metrics to assess model performance across various multimodal reasoning tasks with vision-text contexts. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations on 45 models (including 36 MLLMs) across 16 multimodal datasets, encompassing 6 distinct tasks using 10 different instructions. Our framework introduces multiple innovative metrics, including the “Best Performance” metric to benchmark peak model capabilities, the “Mean Relative Gain” metric to assess overall efficacy across models and instructions, the “Stability” metric to measure robustness, and the “Adaptability” metric to quantify the compatibility between models and instructions. Through comprehensive evaluation and analysis, we uncover several significant insights about model architectures, instruction formats, and their interactions in multimodal reasoning tasks. Our findings establish new benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and provide strategic guidance for future developments. To facilitate continued research and evaluation in this field, we release our framework and resources at https://github.com/declare-lab/MM-InstructEval, with an interactive leaderboard available at MM-InstructEval Leaderboard.}

Rain gardens play a pivotal role in the infiltration and purification of runoff, with the filler layer being a critical component. However, the selection and configuration of fillers in existing rain gardens often lack scientific rigor, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to systematically evaluate 11 types of fillers, including 5 natural materials, 3 industrial wastes, and 3 artificial materials, aiming to optimize filler configurations and enhance the pollutant removal efficiency of rain gardens. The results demonstrate that steel slag, coconut shell biochar, green zeolite, and fly ash ceramic granules exhibit superior performance in purifying both simulated and actual runoff. The optimal filler combination, comprising 25% green zeolite, 25% steel slag, and 50% coconut shell biochar, achieved removal rates of 50.49%, 76.12%, 44.12%, 89.94%, 58.38%, and 88.19% for COD, NH4+-N, TP, Cu(II), Cr(VI), and tetracycline, respectively. Long-term operational evaluation (>110 days) revealed that the optimized filler layer significantly improved the removal rates of COD, TN, and TP to 86.83%, 80.19%, and 88.42%, respectively. By comparing the physicochemical properties of the fillers before and after use, the mechanisms underlying runoff purification were preliminarily elucidated. Different fillers exhibited specific adsorption capabilities for distinct pollutants, and the synergistic effects of multiple fillers significantly enhanced the rain garden's capacity for source pollutant reduction. AHP was used in this study to validate the scientific validity of AHP in the device of rain gardens through filler combination adsorption experiments and long-term monitoring of rain garden installations, while concurrently offering a broader range of green solutions for the enhancement of rain gardens.}

For its second year, the CHI Art Exhibit merged art and technology in fascinating ways.This innovative work can be found in the Proceedings and Extended Abstracts, archived in the ACM Digital Library. For papers, the conference received 2400 submissions which were rigorously reviewed, resulting in 600 accepted papers. To ensure a better fit with reviewers, new subcommittees were created. Across all tracks, CHI received nearly 5000 submissions and accepted over 1000.Our conference theme this year, Explore, Innovate, Inspire, informed our planning process. A new venue held this year was CHI Stories. We generally know little of the personalities that drive the research presented at CHI. CHI Stories is a chance for CHI community members to share personal stories of inspiration, challenge, successes and failures, and grit. We also focused on inclusion this year. Hundreds of CHI attendees volunteered their skills in a Day of Service partnering with non-profit organizations. Inclusion was also manifest throughout the conference, for example, in the Diversity and Inclusion Lunch and by using telepresence robots to enable people with disabilities to participate remotely in the conference. Our keynote speakers were chosen to reflect our conference theme. The speakers were Neri Oxman, who combines computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology; Ben Shneiderman a founder of the CHI conference who, along with some key CHI personalities, gave a perspective on CHI's history and future; Wael Ghonim, credited with starting the Arab Spring and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; and best-selling author Nicholas Carr who challenges us to examine the unforeseen impacts of technology, particularly with automation.The world has experienced a dramatic change this past year. We live in extraordinary times and this calls for extraordinary thinking, something that the CHI community excels at. One of the challenges the community faced this year was responding to a U.S. executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the country to attend CHI. As CHI is committed to inclusion, we decided to hold events at the conference to discuss and plan how we can continue our commitment to inclusion. The conference held a panel to discuss impacts of current political events on science, and hastily organized a panel to promote a conversation of civil liberties in science and a SIG on how the CHI community can participate in change. We are proud to have expanded telepresence options through the use of robots to enable people to participate in the conference remotely if they were physically unable to enter the country. We had a keynote speaker who inspired us on the topic of Internet activism. Our art exhibit, I'll Be Watching You, examined the contemporary issue of surveillance.},

abstract = {This volume contains the papers accepted to the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2008). ICML is the annual conference of the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS), and provides a venue for the presentation and discussion of current research in the field of machine learning. These proceedings can also be found online at http://www.machinelearning.org.This year, ICML was held July 5..9 at the University of Helsinki, in Helsinki, Finland, and was co-located with COLT-2008, the 21st Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, and UAI-2008, the 24th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence. No less than 583 papers were submitted to ICML 2008. There was a very thorough review process, in which each paper was reviewed double-blind by three program committee (PC) members. Authors were able to respond to the initial reviews, and the PC members could then modify their reviews based on online discussions and the content of this author response. There were two discussion periods led by the senior program committee (SPC), one just before and one after the submission of author responses. At the end of the second discussion period, the SPC members gave their recommendations and provided a summary review for each of their papers. Some papers were checked by the SPCs to ensure that reviewer comments had been addressed. Apart from the length restrictions on papers and the compressed time frame, the review process for ICML resembles that of many journal publications. In total, 158 papers were accepted to ICML this year, including a small number of papers which were initially conditionally accepted, yielding an overall acceptance rate of 27\%.ICML authors presented their papers both orally and in a poster session, allowing time for detailed discussions with any interested attendees of the conference. Each day of the main conference included one or two invited talks by a prominent researcher. We were very fortunate to be able to host Michael Collins, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Andrew Ng, of Stanford University; and Luc De Raedt, of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and John Winn of Microsoft Research Cambridge. In addition to the technical talks, ICML- 2008 also included nine tutorials held before the main conference, presented by Alex Smola, Arthur Gretton, and Kenji Fukumizu; Bert Kappen and Marc Toussaint; Neil Lawrence; MartinWainwright; Ralf Herbrich and Thore Graepel; Andreas Krause and Carlos Guestrin; Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Yoram Singer; Rob Fergus; and Matthias Seeger. This year our workshops were organized jointly with COLT and UAI as part of a special "overlap day," consisting of eleven workshops selected and arranged collaboratively by the respective workshop chairs of the three conferences. This day provided a rich opportunity for interaction among the attendees of the conferences.This year, ICML enlarged its award offerings to match several other well-established conferences. We hope these will help build our community, celebrate our advances, and encourage applications and long-term thinking. In addition to our previously traditional "Best Paper" and "Best Student Paper" awards, we also gave awards for "Best Application Paper" and "10-year Best Paper" (for the best paper of ICML 1998, optionally given in conjunction with a co-located conference). We thank the Machine Learning Journal for sponsoring some of our paper awards.},

abstract = {The KDD 2002 conference, held from 23rd to 26th July 2002, was the eighth in the series. It represented a return to the country in which the series was launched: the first was held in Montreal, Canada, and this, the eighth, was held in Edmonton, Canada. In the years between the first conference in the series and this present one, data mining has be, come a well-established discipline. It has continued to strengthen its links to other data analytic disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, visualization, and database technology, but has now clearly carved out a niche of its own. Over the period in which this series has been running, hardware technology has continued to advance in great leaps, with the result that large databases have continued to grow in both number and size. The implication is that the challenge of data mining is even more important, that the problems requiring data mining solutions are ever more ubiquitous, and that new tools and methods for tackling are even more necessary.KDD 2002 received a record number of submitted papers - 307 in total, 37 of which were considered for the industral/applicafion track. Among the 270 research submissions, 32 were selected (12\%) for full papers; and among the 37 industrial/application submissions, 12 (32\%) were selected for full papers. An additional 44 submissions were chosen to be presented as posters, a vast majority of which were research submissions. This low rate of acceptance reflects a conscious effort to maintain the very high standards of quality and relevance, which have been achieved by previous conferences in the series. It means that the papers and posters in the proceedings represent the cutting edge of data mining problemsl solutions, and technology. On the other hand, this policy inevitably meant that many excellent contributions did not make it to the final program. The choice had to be informed by balance as well as quality - KDD 2002 had to showcase research in data mining across the entire frontier of the discipline. This breadth was reflected in the choice of invited speakers, both well known in the data mining; community, but from different backgrounds: Daryl Pregibon and Geoff Hinton. The program also includes 6 workshops in such diverse areas as 'Data Mining in Bioinformatics', 'Web Mining', 'Multimedia Data Mining', 'Multi-Relational Data Mining', 'Temporal Data Mining', and 'Fractals in Data Mining' as well as 6 tutorials on 'Text Mining for Bioinformatics', 'Querying and Mining Data Streams', 'Link Analysis', 'Multivariate Density Estimation', 'Common Reasons Data Mining Projects Fail', and 'Visual Data Mining'.},

abstract = {The KDD conference has seen remarkable growth since its origins as an IJCAI workshop in Detroit in 1989, evolving into a full-fledged research conference in 1995, underscoring the important role data mining as a field has played in extracting knowledge and actionable insights from vast troves of data that is being generated in the digital world around us. This year we received a record 755 submissions to the research program, from which 133 papers were accepted, for an aggregate acceptance rate of 17.6\% (quite similar to recent years).Among the academic conferences, the KDD conference has typically more of an emphasis on research motivated by real-world applications. It is important to keep in mind that it is this synergy of research in areas like algorithms, computational geometry, database, graph theory, machine learning, natural language processing, statistics, visualization and many others when applied to problems arising in diverse fields such as web, medicine, climatology, marketing that drives our field forward, makes it vibrant and fun - who would know that ideas in computational geometry can be adapted to construct fast algorithms to improve online advertising and movie recommendations?The breadth of topics covered in this year's research program is truly comprehensive, including social networks, privacy, text mining, predictive modeling, time-series forecasting, spatial data analysis, geometry, and more. We are very fortunate to have 4 world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge techniques and issues in web mining, information networks, statistical inference for big data, and social computing.The process of whittling down the initial 734 submissions to the final set of 133 accepted papers required the coordination and time of a large number of willing volunteers. The program committee (PC) consisted of over 350 reviewers (PC members) and 50 senior PC members. In the first phase each submitted paper was automatically assigned to 3 reviewers (after a bidding process). Once the reviews from each of the 3 reviewers were completed, the program chairs rejected papers that did not receive much support from any of the reviewers. We rejected 259 papers at this stage. Special care was taken to minimize the error of rejecting a potentially good paper at this stage. The papers that survived the first phase were assigned to the senior PC members based on their bids, they had the option of initiating a discussion for any of their papers, e.g., if there was significant divergence in scores among reviewers, or if a paper was on the borderline of being accepted. Following the discussion phase, the senior PC members provided a recommendation score and a detailed meta-review for each paper. In the final phase, we (the program chairs) analyzed all of this information, starting with the obvious accept and reject decisions, and then gradually focusing in more detail on the papers near the borderline, seeking additional reviews and input from the PC and senior PC members where appropriate. We also initiated a shepherding phase with 15 papers having the opportunity of fixing mild issues we thought would be possible to address before they can be accepted. 13 of them were accepted after thorough revisions. Finally, it is quite likely that in hindsight some worthy papers may have been rejected as part of this process - these errors are an unfortunate reality of modern computer science conferences, and hard to avoid when a very large number of decisions have to be made over a short time span based on a subjective reviewing process. Nevertheless, we, the PC chairs, are responsible for those unfortunate errors and welcome suggestions on the matter.},

The annual ACM SIGKDD conference is the premier international forum for data mining, knowledge discovery and big data. It brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to share their ideas, research results and experiences. KDD-2013 features plenary presentations, paper presentations, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, exhibits, demonstrations, and the KDD Cup competition.Today, you hear a lot about big data, data science and data intensive computing. The core of this work is extracting knowledge and useful information from data, which for science leads to beautiful insights, and for applications leads to actions, alerts and decisions. The KDD community has always been at the center of this activity and it is clear from this conference that it will continue to drive this broader field of big data.This year there were 726 submissions to the KDD Research Track, and 125 papers were accepted. There were 136 submissions to the KDD Industry and Government Track, and 34 papers were accepted.KDD also has a history of inviting talks that are of broad interest to the KDD community. This year we chose to have 4 plenary talks. A program committee also selected 8 talks to present at the Industry Practice Exposition.A strength of the KDD conference is the number of workshops and tutorials that are co-located with it. This year there were 10 full-day workshops, 5 half-day workshops, and 6 tutorials.We thank all sponsors, who are a very important part of the conference, and the members of the Organizing Committee and our other colleagues who volunteered their time during the past year to make this conference a success.

address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {This volume, which is also available online from
http://www.machinelearning.org, contains the papers accepted for
presentation at ICML-2005, the 22nd lnternational Conference on
Machine Learning, which was held at the University of Bonn in
Germany from August 7 to August 11, 2005. ICML is the annual
conference of the lnternational Machine Learning Society (IMLS),
and forms an international forum for the discussion and
presentation of the latest results in the field of machine
learning. This year, ICML was co-located with the 15th
lnternational Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-2005),
the proceedings of which are published by Springer Verlag in a
separate volume.The papers in this volume were selected on the basis of a
thorough review process. In the first round of reviewing, three
program committee members produced individual reviews for a paper.
Authors then had the opportunity to view those reviews and submit
an author's reply to the reviewers. Led by the responsible area
chair, the reviewers then engaged in a discussion about the paper,
ultimately leading to the decision by the program chairs. In sum,
of the 491 papers that were initially submitted, 62 were accepted
immediately, and a further 81 were conditionally accepted and
reconsidered after resubmission in a second round of reviewing. Of
those 81 conditionally accepted papers, 72 were finally accepted,
leading to a total of 134 accepted papers, which translates into an
acceptance rate of 27.3 \%. The author reply was a new feature of
ICML this year, while the option of working with conditional
accepts has already become a tradition.In addition to the presentations of the accepted papers, the
ICML program included several other features. On the first and last
day of the conference, 11 workshops and 6 tutorials on current
topics of machine learning were held. For many of these,
proceedings and/or presentation materials are available online from
the ICML website. The other days of the conference each featured an
invited talk by a prominent researcher as a program highlight. We
were delighted that Johannes Gehrke of Cornell University, Michael
Jordan of the University of California at Berkeley, and Gerhard
Widmer of the University of Linz in Austria, agreed to deliver an
invited talk. The abstracts of their talks are also published as
part of these proceedings.Continuing a long standing tradition at ICML, all papers
presented in a talk at the conference were also exhibited at
evening poster sessions, giving everyone ample time to discuss the
results in depth. In order to emphasize the co-location with
ILP-2005, the program contained joint elements in both invited
speakers, paper sessions, poster sessions, and tutorials. As usual,
the scientific program was complemented by a social program, this
time featuring an excursion to the scenic surroundings of the city
of Bonn.During the conference best paper and best student paper awards
were presented, the former being sponsored by NICTA, the later by
the Machine Learning Journal.},

abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview
of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify
 cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.},

abstract = {Welcome to SIGMOD 2015 -- officially, the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on the Management of Data! This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5\%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

The KDD conferences provide a forum for novel research results and interesting applications in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery. The conference series gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others and to present new research ideas, applications, solutions, tools, systems, and research directions broadly related to knowledge discovery and data mining.The call for papers attracted 465 research submissions and 73 industrial submissions from around the world. The program committee accepted 40 research papers, 36 research posters, 14 industrial papers and 11 industrial posters. In addition, this year's conference includes three plenary talks and two panels.Putting together KDD'05 was a team effort. First, we would like to thank the authors for providing the content of the program and the program committee and external reviewers, who worked very hard in reviewing papers and providing suggestions for their improvements. Second, we would like to thank the Organizing Committee, who also worked very hard, and, as volunteers, didn't get much for it. I strongly encourage you to thank them, and even, perhaps, to let them get out of the elevator ahead of you. Finally, we would like to thank our sponsor, ACM SIGKDD, for their continued support.Daniel Hudson Burnham (1846-1912) was a partner in the Chicago based architecture firm Burnham and Root. Burnham and Root created the foundation for the modern skyscraper by using a floating foundation of cement that provided a stable foundation even when, as in many Chicago locations, it was not possible to reach bedrock. Burnham and Root was also the lead architect for, and in charge of, construction for the World Columbian Exposition (1893), which celebrated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Columbus to North America. The World Columbian Exposition was the largest World's Fair to that date and drew 27.5 million attendees at a time when the US population was about 65 million. To achieve this, many logistic obstacles had to be overcome. Burnham's style is nicely captured by a quote associated with him: "Make no little plans. They have no magic to strike man's blood and probably will themselves not be realized.This is the theme we have chosen for this year's KDD Conference. The field of data mining and knowledge discovery is over ten years old, and is now mature enough to begin to make some big plans and to tackle some very difficult problems and challenges. We will begin discussions about these challenges at this year's conference and continue them throughout the year. Over the coming year, please look to the SIGKDD Explorations for further information.We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought provoking and that the conference will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {The 2002 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, was held June 4-6, 2002 at the spectacular Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Monona Terrace conference center in Madison, Wisconsin. The SIGMOD conference has long held its status a leading forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. This year we are pleased to have a particularly strong program, including significant representation from both industry and academia and contributions from around the world. The SIGMOD conference is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and its Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD). As has become customary, two days of the conference were overlapped with the Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS). In addition, there were a number of important events co-located with SIGMOD this year, including the 5th International Workshop on the Web and Databases (WebDB), the Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD), and the New Database Faculty Symposium.As with previous years, acceptance into the conference proceedings was extremely competitive. From the 240 research program submissions, the program committee selected 42 papers for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. These papers span the range of traditional database topics as well as issues of emerging interest such as data streaming, middle-tier data management, and integration with web services and the WWW. The: program committee worked hard to select these papers through a detailed review process and active discussion both electronically and at the program committee meeting held in January at Berkeley. We are deeply indebted to Surajit Chaudhuri and Jonathan Simon for their efforts in developing and hosting the Conference Management Tool at Microsoft. We used the CMT to run the entire submissions and review process for research papers, including the program committee meeting. We would also like to thank Umesh Dayal, who took on extra work to help manage the review process.In addition to the research track, we had 41 submissions to the Demonstrations track, of which 21 projects were invited to present. The Demonstrations track has become a key venue for the early dissemination of cutting-edge prototype and systems development experience. Paul Aoki chaired the demos program committee, which put together a diverse and exciting program. The Industrial program committee, chaired by Mike Carey took an active role in soliciting quality submissions and have put together a program that is a key component of this year's conference. Likewise, Donald Kossmann and Peter Scheuermann and the tutorial committee organized an excellent slate of Panels and Tutorials to round out the program.},

abstract = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations.We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

abstract = {We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs.DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data.DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI \&amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

The Symposium was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT).In response to a call for papers, 287 paper submissions were received. All were submitted electronically. The program committee conducted its deliberations electronically, via an on-line meeting that ran from January 10 to January 19. The committee selected 91 papers from among the submissions. The submissions were not refereed, and many of these papers represented reports of continuing research. It is expected that most of them will appear in a more polished and complete form in scientific journals.The papers encompassed in wide variety of areas of theoretical computer science. The topics included algorithms and computational complexity bounds for classical problems in algebra, geometry, topology, graph theory, game theory, logic and machine learning, as well as theoretical aspects of security, databases, information retrieval, and networks, the web, computational biology, and alternative models of computation including quantum computation and self-assembly.},

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of context on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of “authorative” information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “hub pages” that join them together in  the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis.},

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63\% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

title = {AAMAS '05: Proceedings of the fourth international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems},
year = {2005},
isbn = {1595930930},
publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems are, in the judgment
of many observers, the most significant new paradigm for software
modelling and development to emerge from Computer Science in the
last two decades. Autonomous Agents are computer programs that are
able to decide between different methods of achieving their
programmed goals. This is in contrast to the scripted, predefined
behaviour that a traditional program, for example a Unix Daemon,
would exhibit, and means that Autonomous Agents can cope with
dynamic environments, can be developed as a quick solution to
complex problems, and can tailor their behaviour to individual
users in a way that traditional software cannot.Multi-Agent Systems are computational environments in which
different programs, possibly developed in isolation, can
co-ordinate their behaviours to achieve their goals. The technology
of Multi-Agent Systems is, therefore, particularly applicable to
modern operational environments like e-business, ubiquitous
computing, and, of course, the Internet.These two topics of research are tightly coupled. For a
Multi-Agent System to be fully implemented, it is often necessary
to utilize the technology of Autonomous Agents. For an Agent to act
with true autonomy in a realistic, modern setting, it must often be
able to reason about other Agents and co-ordinate its behaviour
with them. It is this insight that has led to the development of
the AAMAS community and the spectacularly successful series of
conferences that have been running for the last for years.The AAMAS community has long recognised [Wooldridge &amp;
Jennings 1995] that the significance of the abstractions,
techniques, tools, and technologies developed by the research
community worldwide will only be recognised if they have practical
applications in the real world of science, technology, education,
healthcare, business, and commerce. The paradigm of AAMAS and
available agent technologies has reached a significant level of
maturity, and they are now widely regarded as ready for wider
adoption. The purpose of the First Industry Track of the Autonomous
Agent and Multi-Agent Systems conference is to provide a forum that
will bring real world applications that are being developed by
teams internationally to the attention of the AAMAS community and
the wider world.Why is this important? We have identified several
motivations:•By disseminating the news of successful application of
AAMAS technology we hope to provide researchers with clear evidence
of the success and usefulness of particular techniques.•Feedback from attempts to use AAMAS technology is
valuable in the formation of the AAMAS research agenda.•A forum for discussion of industrial and
application-orientated concerns has been lacking in the community
to date; by providing one, we hope that practitioners will be able
to share their experiences and, therefore, accelerate the uptake of
AAMAS technology.•Finally, we expect that, by providing an industry
track, we will encourage more participation in AAMAS by
practitioners, and that this will lead to a wider understanding of
the importance of AAMAS technology in commercial organisations.Fifteen papers that discuss the application of AAMAS technology
are presented in this collection. They were selected by a
refereeing process that aimed to find work that made use of the
particular properties of AAMAS systems and had actually been used
"in anger." The ratio of submitted to accepted papers was higher
than 2:1; that is, more papers were excluded from presentation than
were accepted.The papers that have been selected by the referees and programme
committee for the track allow the identification of some trends in
the development and application of AAMAS technology. Four out of
fifteen papers are in the field of transport, traffic, and
logistics. Natural problem decomposition, geographical
distribution, and requirements for autonomous decision making make
this domain particularly suitable for AAMAS technology.A further four papers are focused on Aerospace applications. In
this domain, the technological adventurousness of a highly
competitive and demanding industry may explain the work presented.
However, the use of AAMAS technology to provide autonomy for
systems that cannot be easily or cheaply supervised by human
intervention seems to be another clear driver.Three papers focus on using AAMAS technology for manufacturing
applications. Here, the drivers seem to have been to use Agent
Autonomy or co-ordination techniques to provide cost savings,
realised by removing large numbers of repetitive management and
control tasks.The track also features papers which describe the use of AAMAS
technology for electricity network management and to provide a
training system for naval personnel. Both of these papers point to
cost savings realised by automating decision making processes.Just as we can see trends in the papers that have been selected
for publication, it's also interesting to point to missing areas.
There are no papers from promising domains for AAMAS adoption
including telecommunications, internet, pharmaceuticals,
eGovernment, or healthcare. Similarl,y the submission rate from
small companies and start-ups was expected to be somewhat higher.
These are areas that have been explored extensively in the past
[Luck et-al 2003] so it is important for the AAMAS community to
investigate why the research that has been performed has not
matured into published case studies at this time.Although the collection is diverse, all the papers share two
common traits. Every paper is the result of the efforts of a team
that has been prepared to take the risk of adopting a new
technology in a high pressure environment, and every paper
summarises what happens when talented people take a risk and that
risk pays off. We salute all these pioneers, and look forward to
the presentation of the technical program and the discussions that
are bound to result.},

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.},

In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous  objections  to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.},

In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous  objections  to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.},

abstract = {CHI 2017 is the premier international conference for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This year it was held in Denver, bordering the beautiful Rocky Mountain region in the U.S., and reflected in our logo. The CHI 2017 conference began with two days of workshops and symposia, followed by four days of a technical program with 17 parallel sessions of provocative papers, panels, case studies, SIGs (Special Interest Groups), courses, and the popular student research, design, and game competitions. The growing alt.chi forum, now in its twelfth year, presented stimulating new ideas in HCI. The Interactivity forum showcased cutting-edge technology. For its second year, the CHI Art Exhibit merged art and technology in fascinating ways.This innovative work can be found in the Proceedings and Extended Abstracts, archived in the ACM Digital Library. For papers, the conference received 2400 submissions which were rigorously reviewed, resulting in 600 accepted papers. To ensure a better fit with reviewers, new subcommittees were created. Across all tracks, CHI received nearly 5000 submissions and accepted over 1000.Our conference theme this year, Explore, Innovate, Inspire, informed our planning process. A new venue held this year was CHI Stories. We generally know little of the personalities that drive the research presented at CHI. CHI Stories is a chance for CHI community members to share personal stories of inspiration, challenge, successes and failures, and grit. We also focused on inclusion this year. Hundreds of CHI attendees volunteered their skills in a Day of Service partnering with non-profit organizations. Inclusion was also manifest throughout the conference, for example, in the Diversity and Inclusion Lunch and by using telepresence robots to enable people with disabilities to participate remotely in the conference. Our keynote speakers were chosen to reflect our conference theme. The speakers were Neri Oxman, who combines computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology; Ben Shneiderman a founder of the CHI conference who, along with some key CHI personalities, gave a perspective on CHI's history and future; Wael Ghonim, credited with starting the Arab Spring and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; and best-selling author Nicholas Carr who challenges us to examine the unforeseen impacts of technology, particularly with automation.The world has experienced a dramatic change this past year. We live in extraordinary times and this calls for extraordinary thinking, something that the CHI community excels at. One of the challenges the community faced this year was responding to a U.S. executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the country to attend CHI. As CHI is committed to inclusion, we decided to hold events at the conference to discuss and plan how we can continue our commitment to inclusion. The conference held a panel to discuss impacts of current political events on science, and hastily organized a panel to promote a conversation of civil liberties in science and a SIG on how the CHI community can participate in change. We are proud to have expanded telepresence options through the use of robots to enable people to participate in the conference remotely if they were physically unable to enter the country. We had a keynote speaker who inspired us on the topic of Internet activism. Our art exhibit, I'll Be Watching You, examined the contemporary issue of surveillance.},

abstract = {This article is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the ℓ1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

  title={Machine Learning With Big Data: Challenges and Approaches},

  volume={5},

  pages={7776-7797},
  abstract={The Big Data revolution promises to transform how we live, work, and think by enabling process optimization, empowering insight discovery and improving decision making. The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause–effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented. Through this process, this paper provides a perspective on the domain, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and provides a strong foundation and encouragement for further research in the field of machine learning with Big Data.},

  pages={78729-78757},
  abstract={Frequencies from 100 GHz to 3 THz are promising bands for the next generation of wireless communication systems because of the wide swaths of unused and unexplored spectrum. These frequencies also offer the potential for revolutionary applications that will be made possible by new thinking, and advances in devices, circuits, software, signal processing, and systems. This paper describes many of the technical challenges and opportunities for wireless communication and sensing applications above 100 GHz, and presents a number of promising discoveries, novel approaches, and recent results that will aid in the development and implementation of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, and beyond. This paper shows recent regulatory and standard body rulings that are anticipating wireless products and services above 100 GHz and illustrates the viability of wireless cognition, hyper-accurate position location, sensing, and imaging. This paper also presents approaches and results that show how long distance mobile communications will be supported to above 800 GHz since the antenna gains are able to overcome air-induced attenuation, and present methods that reduce the computational complexity and simplify the signal processing used in adaptive antenna arrays, by exploiting the Special Theory of Relativity to create a cone of silence in over-sampled antenna arrays that improve performance for digital phased array antennas. Also, new results that give insights into power efficient beam steering algorithms, and new propagation and partition loss models above 100 GHz are given, and promising imaging, array processing, and position location results are presented. The implementation of spatial consistency at THz frequencies, an important component of channel modeling that considers minute changes and correlations over space, is also discussed. This paper offers the first in-depth look at the vast applications of THz wireless products and applications and provides approaches for how to reduce power and increase performance across several problem domains, giving early evidence that THz techniques are compelling and available for future wireless communications.},

  title={Exploring Students’ Perceptions of ChatGPT: Thematic Analysis and Follow-Up Survey}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={38805-38818},
  abstract={ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and skepticism in education. To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program ( $n=56$ ). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT’s answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.},

  pages={2266-2277},
  abstract={In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  pages={100943-100953},
  abstract={Emotion is intrinsic to humans and consequently, emotion understanding is a key part of human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is becoming increasingly popular as a new research frontier in natural language processing (NLP) due to its ability to mine opinions from the plethora of publicly available conversational data on platforms such as Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, and others. Moreover, it has potential applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis), education (understanding student frustration), and more. In Addition, ERC is also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an understanding of the user’s emotions. Catering to these needs calls for effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However, it is a difficult problem to solve because of several research challenges. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and shed light on recent research in this field. We also describe the drawbacks of these approaches and discuss the reasons why they fail to successfully overcome the research challenges in ERC.},

  abstract={Exponential technological expansion creates opportunities for competitive advantage by applying new data-oriented approaches to digital marketing practices. Machine learning (ML) can predict future developments and support decision-making by extracting insights from large amounts of generated data. This functionality greatly impacts and streamlines the strategic decision-making process of organizations. The research gap analysis revealed that a little is known about marketers' attitude toward, and knowledge about, ML tools and their adoption and utilization to support strategic and operational management. The research presented here focuses on the selection and adoption of the ML-driven analytical tools by three distinct groups: marketing agencies, media companies, and advertisers. Qualitative and quantitative research was conducted on a sample of these organizations operating in Slovakia. The findings highlight: 1) the important role of intelligent analytical tools in the creation and deployment of marketing strategies; 2) the lack of knowledge about emerging technologies, such as ML and artificial intelligence (AI); 3) the potential application of the ML tools in marketing, and; 4) the low level of adoption and utilization of the ML-driven analytical tools in marketing management. A framework consisting of enablers and a process map was developed to help organizations identify the opportunities and successfully execute projects that are oriented toward the deployment and adoption of the analytical ML tools in digital marketing.},

  abstract={Technologies like AI and IoT have been employed in farming for some time now, along with other forms of cutting-edge computer science. There has been a shift in recent years toward thinking about how to put this new technology to use. Agriculture has provided a large portion of humanity’s sustenance for thousands of years, with its most notable contribution being the widespread use of effective agricultural practices for several crop types. The advent of cutting-edge IoT know-how with the ability to monitor agricultural ecosystems and guarantee high-quality production is underway. Smart Sustainable Agriculture continues to face formidable hurdles due to the widespread dispersion of agricultural procedures, such as the deployment and administration of IoT and AI devices, the sharing of data and administration, interoperability, and the analysis and storage of enormous data quantities. This work initially analyses existing Internet-of-Things technologies used in Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA) to discover architectural components that might facilitate the development of SSA platforms. This paper examines the state of research and development in SSA, pays attention to the current form of information, and proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) framework as a starting point for SSA.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={110558-110572},
  abstract={Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},

  pages={60063-60076},
  abstract={Driver inattention and distraction are the main causes of road accidents, many of which result in fatalities. To reduce road accidents, the development of information systems to detect driver inattention and distraction is essential. Currently, distraction detection systems for road vehicles are not yet widely available or are limited to specific causes of driver inattention such as driver fatigue. Despite the increasing automation of driving due to the availability of increasingly sophisticated assistance systems, the human driver will continue to play a longer role as supervisor of vehicle automation. With this in mind, we review the published scientific literature on driver distraction detection methods and integrate the identified approaches into a holistic framework that is the main contribution of the paper. Based on published scientific work, our driver distraction detection framework contains a structured summary of reviewed approaches for detecting the three main distraction detection approaches: manual distraction, visual distraction, and cognitive distraction. Our framework visualizes the whole detection information chain from used sensors, measured data, computed data, computed events, inferred behavior, and inferred distraction type. Besides providing a sound summary for researchers interested in distracted driving, we discuss several practical implications for the development of driver distraction detection systems that can also combine different approaches for higher detection quality. We think our research can be useful despite - or even because of - the great developments in automated driving.},

  title={From Big Data to Deep Data to Support People Analytics for Employee Attrition Prediction},

  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={60447-60458},
  abstract={In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking `big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking `deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that `business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.},

  abstract={The importance of educating the next generations in the understanding of the fundamentals of the upcoming scientific and technological innovations that will force a broad social and economical paradigm change can not be overstressed. One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.},

We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.},

  abstract={The main and pivot part of electric companies is the load forecasting. Decision-makers and think tank of power sectors should forecast the future need of electricity with large accuracy and small error to give uninterrupted and free of load shedding power to consumers. The demand of electricity can be forecasted amicably by many Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques among which hybrid methods are most popular. The present technologies of load forecasting and present work regarding combination of various ML, DL and AI algorithms are reviewed in this paper. The comprehensive review of single and hybrid forecasting models with functions; advantages and disadvantages are discussed in this paper. The comparison between the performance of the models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values are compared and discussed with literature of different models to support the researchers to select the best model for load prediction. This comparison validates the fact that the hybrid forecasting models will provide a more optimal solution.},

  abstract={The augmented reality (AR) applications have been widely used in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) because of good immersion experience for users, but their ultralow delay demand and high energy consumption bring a huge challenge to the current communication system and terminal power. The emergence of mobile-edge computing (MEC) provides a good thinking to solve this challenge. In this article, we study an energy-efficient task offloading and resource allocation scheme for AR in both the single-MEC and multi-MEC systems. First, a more specific and detailed AR application model is established as a directed acyclic graph according to its internal functionality. Second, based on this AR model, a joint optimization problem of task offloading and resource allocation is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of each user subject to the latency requirement and the limited resources. The problem is a mixed multiuser competition and cooperation problem, which involves the task offloading decision, uplink/downlink transmission resources allocation, and computing resources allocation of users and MEC server. Since it is an NP-hard problem and the communication environment is dynamic, it is difficult for genetic algorithms or heuristic algorithms to solve. Therefore, we propose an intelligent and efficient resource allocation and task offloading algorithm based on the deep reinforcement learning framework of multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) in a dynamic communication environment. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the energy consumption of each user terminal.},

  year={2022},
  volume={16},
  number={1},
  pages={24-35},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection and system level power reduction of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) Edge sensors. The proposed network utilizes a novel hybrid architecture consisting of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The LSTM block takes a sequence of coefficients representing the morphology of ECG beats while the MLP input layer is fed with features derived from instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous training of the blocks pushes the overall network to learn distinct features complementing each other for making decisions. The network was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the dataset using SMOTE algorithm for network training. The network achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% across several records in the database. Further, the network was mapped to a fixed point model, retrained in a bit accurate fixed-point environment to compensate for the quantization error, and ported to an ARM Cortex M4 based embedded platform. In laboratory testing, the overall system was successfully demonstrated, and a significant saving of $\simeq \!\! 50\%$ power was achieved by gating the wireless transmission using the classifier. Wireless transmission was enabled only to transmit the beats deemed anomalous by the classifier. The proposed technique compares favourably with current methods in terms of computational complexity and has the advantage of stand-alone operation in the edge node, without the need for always-on wireless connectivity making it ideal for IoT wearable devices.},

  abstract={Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data repositories—performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration, reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories: analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s. Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing’s full potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and enforcing data privacy requirements.},

Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},

  pages={37191-37201},
  abstract={The current thinking concerning computations required by Internet of Things (IoT) applications is shifting toward fog computing instead of cloud computing, thereby achieving most of the required computations at the network edge of the IoT devices. Fog computing can thus improve the quality of service of delay-sensitive applications by allowing such applications to take advantage of the low latency provided by fog computing rather than the high latency of the cloud. Therefore, tasks in various IoT applications must be effectively distributed over the fog nodes to improve the quality of service, specifically the task response time. In this paper, two nature-inspired meta-heuristic schedulers, namely ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are used to propose two different scheduling algorithms to effectively load balance IoT tasks over the fog nodes under communication cost and response time considerations. The experimental results of the proposed algorithms are compared with those of the round robin (RR) algorithm. The evaluations show that the proposed ACO-based scheduler achieves an improvement in the response times of IoT applications compared to the proposed PSO-based and RR algorithms and effectively load balances the fog nodes.},

  abstract={Growing electricity demand, the deployment of renewable energy sources and the widespread use of smart home appliances provide new opportunities for home energy management systems (HEMSs), which can be defined as systems that improve the overall energy production and consumption of residential buildings by controlling and scheduling the use of household equipment. By saving energy, reducing residential electricity costs, optimizing the utilization rate and reliability of utility companies’ power systems, and reducing air pollution for society, HEMSs lead to an enhancement in the socioeconomic development of low-carbon economies. This review aims to systematically analyze and summarize the development trends and challenges of HEMSs in recent years. This paper reviews the development history of the HEMS architecture and discusses the characteristics of several major communication technologies in the current HEMS infrastructure. In addition, the common objectives and constraints related to scheduling optimization are classified, and several optimization methods in the literature, including various intelligent algorithms, have been introduced, compared, and critically analyzed. Furthermore, experimental studies and challenges in the real world are also summarized and recommendations are given. This paper reveals the trend from simple to complex in the architecture and functionality of HEMSs, discusses the challenges for future improvements in modeling and scheduling, and shows the development of various modeling and scheduling methods. Based on this review, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of current research trends in HEMSs and open up ideas for developing new modeling and scheduling approaches by gaining insight into the trade-offs between optimum solutions and computational complexity.},

  abstract={Dealing with uncertainty is always a challenging problem, and different tools have been proposed to deal with it. Recently, a new model that is based on hesitant fuzzy sets has been presented to manage situations in which experts hesitate between several values to assess an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. Hesitant fuzzy sets suit the modeling of quantitative settings; however, similar situations may occur in qualitative settings so that experts think of several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. In this paper, the concept of a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is introduced to provide a linguistic and computational basis to increase the richness of linguistic elicitation based on the fuzzy linguistic approach and the use of context-free grammars by using comparative terms. Then, a multicriteria linguistic decision-making model is presented in which experts provide their assessments by eliciting linguistic expressions. This decision model manages such linguistic expressions by means of its representation using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets.},

  abstract={Quantum computing is aninterdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science, and finds applications in areas including optimization, machine learning, and simulation of chemical, physical, and biological systems. It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9–12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.},

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.},

abstract = {A program denotes computations in some universe of objects. Abstract interpretation of programs consists in using that denotation to describe computations in another universe of abstract objects, so that the results of abstract execution give some information on the actual computations. An intuitive example (which we borrow from Sintzoff [72]) is the rule of signs. The text -1515 * 17 may be understood to denote computations on the abstract universe {(+), (-), (±)} where the semantics of arithmetic operators is defined by the rule of signs. The abstract execution -1515 * 17 → -(+) * (+) → (-) * (+) → (-), proves that -1515 * 17 is a negative number. Abstract interpretation is concerned by a particular underlying structure of the usual universe of computations (the sign, in our example). It gives a summary of some facets of the actual executions of a program. In general this summary is simple to obtain but inaccurate (e.g. -1515 + 17 → -(+) + (+) → (-) + (+) → (±)). Despite its fundamentally incomplete results abstract interpretation allows the programmer or the compiler to answer questions which do not need full knowledge of program executions or which tolerate an imprecise answer, (e.g. partial correctness proofs of programs ignoring the termination problems, type checking, program optimizations which are not carried in the absence of certainty about their feasibility, …).},

(viii) is described in a soon-to-be-published RFC.Algorithms (i) - (v) spring from one observation: The flow on a TCP connection (or ISO TP-4 or Xerox NS SPP connection) should obey a 'conservation of packets' principle. And, if this principle were obeyed, congestion collapse would become the exception rather than the rule. Thus congestion control involves finding places that violate conservation and fixing them.By 'conservation of packets' I mean that for a connection 'in equilibrium', i.e., running stably with a full window of data in transit, the packet flow is what a physicist would call 'conservative': A new packet isn't put into the network until an old packet leaves. The physics of flow predicts that systems with this property should be robust in the face of congestion. Observation of the Internet suggests that it was not particularly robust. Why the discrepancy?There are only three ways for packet conservation to fail:
The connection doesn't get to equilibrium, orA sender injects a new packet before an old packet has exited, orThe equilibrium can't be reached because of resource limits along the path. In the following sections, we treat each of these in turn.},

And, if this principle were obeyed, congestion collapse would become the exception rather than the rule. Thus congestion control involves finding places that violate conservation and fixing them.By 'conservation of packets' I mean that for a connection 'in equilibrium', i.e., running stably with a full window of data in transit, the packet flow is what a physicist would call 'conservative': A new packet isn't put into the network until an old packet leaves. The physics of flow predicts that systems with this property should be robust in the face of congestion. Observation of the Internet suggests that it was not particularly robust. Why the discrepancy?There are only three ways for packet conservation to fail:
The connection doesn't get to equilibrium, orA sender injects a new packet before an old packet has exited, orThe equilibrium can't be reached because of resource limits along the path. In the following sections, we treat each of these in turn.},

abstract = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},

abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 −1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where  p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes. Metrics within each equivalency class were strongly correlated, while metrics from different equivalency classes were uncorrelated.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the ``LINE,'' which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available onlinefootnote{url{https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE}}.},

This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

Sponsored by ACM's special interest groups on computer-human interaction (SIGCHI) and computer graphics (SIGGRAPH), UIST brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas including graphical \&amp; web user interfaces, tangible \&amp; ubiquitous computing, virtual \&amp; augmented reality, multimedia, new input \&amp; output devices, fabrication, wearable computing and CSCW.UIST 2015 received 297 technical paper submissions. After a thorough review process, the 39-member program committee accepted 70 papers (23.6\%). Each anonymous submission that entered the full review process was first reviewed by three external reviewers, and a meta-review was provided by a program committee member. If, after these four reviews, the submission was deemed to pass a rebuttal threshold, we asked the authors to submit a short rebuttal addressing the reviewers' concerns. A second member of the program committee was then asked to examine the paper, rebuttal, and reviews, and to provide their own meta-review. The program committee met in person in Berkeley, California, USA on June 25th and 26th, 2015, to select which papers to invite for the program. Submissions were accepted only after the authors provided a final revision addressing the committee's comments.In addition to papers, our program includes two papers from the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction journal (TOCHI), as well as 22 posters, 45 demonstrations, and 8 student presentations in the eleventh annual Doctoral Symposium. Our program also features the seventh annual Student Innovation Contest. Teams from all over the world will compete in this year's contest, which focuses on blurring the lines between art and engineering and creating tools for robotic storytelling. UIST 2015 will feature two keynote presentations. The opening keynote will be given by Ramesh Raskar (MIT Media Lab) on extreme computational imaging. Blaise Aguera Y Arcas from Google will deliver the closing keynote on machine intelligence.We welcome you to Charlotte, a city full of southern hospitality. We hope that you will find the technical program interesting and thought-provoking. We also hope that UIST 2015 will provide you with enjoyable opportunities to engage with fellow researchers from both industry and academia, from institutions around the world.},

Directed diffusion is datacentric in that all communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network.},

This is the proceedings of the 20th annual ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, systems, languages, and Applications, which was initiated in 1986. Technical papers present new ideas, new research, or in-depth reflections on languages, systems, and applications, focusing on objects. This year is first time that the technical program has been split into three parts: research papers, which describe substantiated new research or novel technical results, advance the state of the art, or report on significant experience or experimentation; Onward! papers, which describe new paradigms or metaphors in computing, new thinking about objects, new framings of computational problems or systems, and new technologies; and essays, which are explorations of technology and its impacts, presenting in-depth reflections on technology, its relation to human endeavors, and its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical, r anthropological underpinnings.Each submission was judged on these criteria:Technical contribution--how substantial is the contributionNovelty--how novel or innovative are the ideasSubstantiation--how well proven is the contributionPresentation--how clearly written and presented is the materialArgument--how compelling or well-made are the arguments in the paperArt/Craft--how well does the paper demonstrate, describe, or promote excellence of artistry or craft in architecture, design, implementation, methodology, or documentationEach paper was assigned to at least three reviewers. Moreover, each paper and its reviews were further reviewed by the leaders of 16 focus groups (Analysis and Design Methods; Design Patterns; Distributed Systems; Experience with OO Applications and Systems; Frameworks and Components; Languages/Design; Languages/Implementation; Languages/Aspects; Object Databases and Persistence; Object Testing and Metrics; Parallel Systems; Programming Environments; Real-Time Systems; Reflection and Metaobject Models; Software Engineering Practices; Theoretical Foundations) who could assign further reviews. Therefore, each paper had in effect four reviews, with some having as many as nine.Each submitted paper co-authored by a program committee member was held to a much higher standard of review through a specific voting process designed to be auditable by the conference chair; each such paper was reviewed by at least six other committee members, on the basis of strict anonymity. The author of a program committee paper was required to leave the meeting room while the paper was being discussed. This year, five papers were submitted by program committee members and none were accepted.In all, 74 papers were submitted and 32 were accepted. OOPSLA 2005 continues the tradition of presenting well-written, carefully selected papers that should be of lasting value to the programming and object communities. And I hope that the new traditions started this year in pursuit of the themes of Explore / Discover / Understand serve well the community of researchers, practitioners, educations, and software thinkers.},

abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

abstract = {Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.},

abstract = {Robust and powerful software instrumentation tools are essential for program analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation, and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable, transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools (called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an application at the instruction level without the need for detailed knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example, Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32 (32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium®, and ARM. In the ten months since Pin 2 was released in July 2004, there have been over 3000 downloads from its website.},

Often, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information. The models should not expose private information in these datasets. Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.},

In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol PR for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an “appropriately chosen” function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2011). HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual conference that showcases the very best research and thinking in human-robot interaction. HRI is inherently interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, reflecting work from researchers in robotics, psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, linguistics, artificial intelligence, organizational behavior, and anthropology.The theme of HRI 2011 is "Real World HRI." The theme is intended to highlight HRI in which basic scientific research is further tested in real world settings or applied to questions that arise in real world settings. One central aspect of this type of research, in contrast to other realms of applied research, is that it is theoretically driven and feeds back to our theoretical understandings. As such, real world research fortifies our understanding of people, robots, and interaction between the two. This year's conference seeks to take up grand challenges of deploying real world human-robot systems.This year we have three keynote speakers. They will discuss their work on gesture (Sotaro Kita), biologically inspired computational vision (Randy O'Reilly), and cognitive robotics (Angelo Cangelosi). We also have a panel to highlight the conference theme: HRI in the real world. This panel brings together leaders from business and industrial robotics that are relying on current robotic technology to accomplish work in the world today.The call for papers attracted 149 full paper submissions (eight page papers) from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. The program committee conducted a rigorous review process for full papers, accepting 33 full papers for oral presentation and publication in the proceedings. This year, taking advantage of having both ACM and IEEE as the sponsor, all papers are archived in both the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.Furthermore, 123 late-breaking reports (two page brief papers) were screened for relevance and lightly reviewed; 99 were accepted for presentation at the HRI conference as posters, exposing a broader perspective of solutions, challenges and issues in HRI. They will be made available in the IEEE Xplore as well as the ACM Digital Library. Finally, a total of 18 videos (out of 36 submissions) were accepted based on importance, novelty and entertainment value. Four videos will be shown throughout the conference and the remaining videos will be shown in a special video session.Presented papers describe novel interaction techniques, the design of new robots, experimental evaluations of people and robots, and robots in real-world settings.This year the local hosts will provide three research laboratory tours during the lunch breaks. We hope that visitors enjoy the opportunity to experience the research ideas of the local hosts.},

abstract = {Network use has evolved to be dominated by content distribution and retrieval, while networking technology still speaks only of connections between hosts. Accessing content and services requires mapping from the what that users care about to the network's where. We present Content-Centric Networking (CCN) which treats content as a primitive - decoupling location from identity, security and access, and retrieving content by name. Using new approaches to routing named content, derived heavily from IP, we can simultaneously achieve scalability, security and performance. We implemented our architecture's basic features and demonstrate resilience and performance with secure file downloads and VoIP calls.},

abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

  abstract={Programming is considered a skill to arouse and inspire learner's potential. Learning to program is a complex process that requires students to write grammar and instructions. The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students. The students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to the dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.},

  pages={186233-186256},
  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  abstract={Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay between internal and external representations can benefit our understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal and external representations and how interaction is related to these representations. In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the high-level relationships between mental models and external visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development},

  abstract={Generative AI (GAI) technologies like ChatGPT are permanently changing academic education. Their integration opens up vast opportunities for bespoke learning and better student interaction but also brings about academic honesty issues and the application of real-life educators. This study aims to fill the literature gap regarding the use of multiple GAI tools and their effect on academic outcomes via a comprehensive review. A systematic literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines to synthesize results on the potential and drawbacks of GAI in educational domains. We included theoretical and empirical papers that used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs. We have also explored conceptual frameworks and the most creative AI applications with a special emphasis on uniqueness and practicability. Experiences, and Perceptions Concerning To compile the information needed we gathered insights into what students were going through by conducting the survey which contains 200 respondents of undergraduate university students gathering insights into the college students’ experiences and perceptions related to GAI used for educational purposes. At the basic level, GAI comprises areas like personalization, task automation, teacher assistance, and efficiency among others, and respective solutions for the immersion of a learner in learning processes to reform directions. However, it generates plenty of challenges such as the question of assessment integrity, the risk that too much automated grading could overwhelm educational value, and relevantly the veracity of AI-generated content as well as the potential disruption to skills like critical thinking, in addition to data privacy and ethical issues. Student Perception Survey the text also indicates that most students, as per the student perception survey found AI systems useful in academic support. However, they also know the other side of the coin and are very familiar with the technology constraints and challenges.},

  number={},
  pages={698-710},
  abstract={From an engineering point-of-view, cognitive control is inspired by the prefrontal cortex of the human brain; cognitive control may therefore be viewed as the overarching function of a cognitive dynamic system. In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional  \(Q\) -learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning.},

  abstract={Crowd sourcing is evolving as a distributed problem-solving and business production model in recent years. In crowd sourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company's production cost can be greatly reduced. In 2003, Luis von Ahn and his colleagues pioneered the concept of "human computation", which utilizes human abilities to perform computation tasks that are difficult for computers to process. Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis.

  title={Artificial Muscle Intelligence System With Deep Learning for Post-Stroke Assistance and Rehabilitation},

  pages={133463-133473},
  abstract={Stroke is one of the prime reasons for paralysis throughout the world caused due to impaired nervous system and resulting in disability to move the affected body parts. Rehabilitation is the natural remedy for recovering from paralysis and enhancing the quality of life. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) controlled assistive technology is the new paradigm, providing assistance and rehabilitation for the paralysed. But, most of these devices are error prone and also hard to get continuous control because of the dynamic nature of the brain signals. Moreover, existing devices like exoskeletons brings additional burden on the patient and the caregivers and also results in mental fatigue and frustration. To solve these issues Artificial Muscle Intelligence with Deep Learning (AMIDL) system is proposed in this paper. AMIDL integrates user intentions with artificial muscle movements in an efficient way to improve the performance. Human thoughts captured using Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors are transformed into body movements, by utilising microcontroller and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device. EEG signals are subjected to pre-processing, feature extraction and classification, before being passed on to the affected body part. The received EEG signal is correlated with the recorded artificial muscle movements. If the captured EEG signal falls below the desired level, the affected body part will be stimulated by the recorded artificial muscle movements. The system also provides a feature for communicating human intentions as alert message to caregivers, in case of emergency situations. This is achieved by offline training of specific gesture and online gesture recognition algorithm. The recognised gesture is transformed into speech, thus enabling the paralysed to express their feelings to the relatives or friends. Experiments were carried out with the aid of healthy and paralysed subjects. The AMIDL system helped to reduce mental fatigue, miss-operation, frustration and provided continuous control. The thrust of lifting the exoskeleton is also reduced by using light weight wireless electrodes. The proposed system will be a great communication aid for paralysed to express their thoughts and feelings with dear and near ones, thereby enhancing the quality of life.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is one of today's most exciting technology because of its cost-reducing, flexibility, and scalability. With the fast growing of cloud computing technology, Data security becomes more and more important in it. In evaluating whether to move to cloud computing, it is important to compare benefits and also risks of it. Thus, security and other existed issues in the cloud cause cloud clients need more time to think about moving to cloud environments. But Security-related topics is one of the most arguable issues in the cloud computing which caused several enterprises looks to this technology uncertainly and move toward it warily. In this paper I try to summarize cloud computing RAS (Reliability, Availability, and Security) issues and also clarify available solution for some of them. In this paper I try to summarize virtualization level of cloud computing security in detailed view.},

  abstract={Emotion recognition involves accurately interpreting human emotions from various sources and modalities, including questionnaires, verbal, and physiological signals. With its broad applications in affective computing, computational creativity, human-robot interactions, and market research, the field has seen a surge in interest in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) techniques developed from 2014 to 2024, encompassing verbal, physiological signals, facial, body gesture, and speech as well as emerging methods like sketches emotion recognition. The review explores various emotion models, distinguishing between emotions, feelings, sentiments, and moods, along with human emotional expression, categorized in both artistic and non-verbal ways. It also discusses the background of automated emotion recognition systems and introduces seven criteria for evaluating modalities alongside a current state analysis of MER, drawn from the human-centric perspective of this field. By selecting the PRISMA guidelines and carefully analyzing 45 selected articles, this review provides comprehensive perspectives into existing studies, datasets, technical approaches, identified gaps, and future directions in MER. It also highlights existing challenges and current applications of the MER.},

  title={A Literature Survey and Empirical Study of Meta-Learning for Classifier Selection}, 
  year={2020},

  pages={10262-10281},
  abstract={Classification is the key and most widely studied paradigm in machine learning community. The selection of appropriate classification algorithm for a particular problem is a challenging task, formally known as algorithm selection problem (ASP) in literature. It is increasingly becoming focus of research in machine learning community. Meta-learning has demonstrated substantial success in solving ASP, especially in the domain of classification. Considerable progress has been made in classification algorithm recommendation and researchers have proposed various methods in literature that tackles ASP in many different ways in meta-learning setup. Yet there is a lack of survey and comparative study that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. To fill these gaps, in this paper we first present a literature survey of classification algorithm recommendation methods. The survey shed light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifier selection through meta-learning and comprehensively discusses the different phases of classifier selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we critically analyzed and summarized the existing studies from the literature in three important dimensions i.e., meta-features, meta-learner and meta-target. In the second part of this paper, we present extensive comparative evaluation of all the prominent methods for classifier selection based on 17 classification algorithms and 84 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of classifier selection methods and highlight the limitations and strengths of meta-features, meta-learners and meta-target in classification algorithm recommendation system. Finally, we conclude this paper by identifying current challenges and suggesting future work directions. We expect that this work will provide baseline and a solid overview of state of the art works in this domain to new researchers, and will steer future research in this direction.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={145-158},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) architecture, a functionally-sliced microarchitecture with memory units interleaved with vector and matrix deep learning functional units in order to take advantage of dataflow locality of deep learning operations. The TSP is built based on two key observations: (1) machine learning workloads exhibit abundant data parallelism, which can be readily mapped to tensors in hardware, and (2) a simple and deterministic processor with producer-consumer stream programming model enables precise reasoning and control of hardware components, achieving good performance and power efficiency. The TSP is designed to exploit parallelism inherent in machine-learning workloads including instruction-level, memory concurrency, data and model parallelism, while guaranteeing determinism by eliminating all reactive elements in the hardware (e.g. arbiters, and caches). Early ResNet50 image classification results demonstrate 20.4K processed images per second (IPS) with a batch-size of one— a $4 \times$ improvement compared to other modern GPUs and accelerators [44]. Our first ASIC implementation of the TSP architecture yields a computational density of more than 1 TeraOp/s per square mm of silicon for its $25 \times 29$ mm 14nm chip operating at a nominal clock frequency of 900 MHz. The TSP demonstrates a novel hardware-software approach to achieve fast, yet predictable, performance on machine-learning workloads within a desired power envelope.},

PHS uses artificial healthcare systems to model and represent patients’ conditions, diagnosis, and treatment process, then applies computational experiments to analyze and evaluate various therapeutic regimens, and implements parallel execution for decision-making support and real-time optimization in both actual and artificial healthcare processes. In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.},

  abstract={Computation occurred within human brain is very much awesome and is not possible to be emulated 100% exactly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) method-based machines. What scientists did and have been done so far up to now are to try to model it as close as to what exactly occurs within the brain. Human brain has an awesome mechanism in performing computation with the end result is new knowledge and human uses the knowledge to actuate his organs. In this paper we will show a new approach for emulating the computation occured within human brain to obtain new knowledge based on the inputs sensed by the system's sensory system taken from the environment. When this process is carried out recursively, the system's knowledge becomes newer and newer, and it is called as knowledge growing. This approach is designed for an agent that has ability to think and act rationally like human. Our cognitive modelling approach is resulted in a model of human information processing and a technique to obtain the most maximum performance should be taken by the cognitive agent. This method is called as A3S (Arwin-Adang-Aciek-Sembiring), the agent is called as Knowledge-Growing System (KGS) and this brain-inspired method opens a new perspective in AI that we call as Cognitive Artificial Intelligence (CAI).},

  abstract={Image inpainting involves filling in part of an image or video using information from the surrounding area. Applications include the restoration of damaged photographs and movies and the removal of selected objects. We introduce a class of automated methods for digital inpainting. The approach uses ideas from classical fluid dynamics to propagate isophote lines continuously from the exterior into the region to be inpainted. The main idea is to think of the image intensity as a 'stream function for a two-dimensional incompressible flow. The Laplacian of the image intensity plays the role of the vorticity of the fluid; it is transported into the region to be inpainted by a vector field defined by the stream function. The resulting algorithm is designed to continue isophotes while matching gradient vectors at the boundary of the inpainting region. The method is directly based on the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, which has the immediate advantage of well-developed theoretical and numerical results. This is a new approach for introducing ideas from computational fluid dynamics into problems in computer vision and image analysis.},

  abstract={The remarkable achievements of ChatGPT and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) have sparked a wave of interest and research in the field of large language models (LLMs) for artificial general intelligence (AGI). These models provide intelligent solutions that are closer to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing (RS), the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research in RS focuses primarily on visual-understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-LMs (VLMs) excel as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. VLMs can go beyond visual recognition of RS images and can model semantic relationships as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). This article provides a comprehensive review of the research on VLMs in RS, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of VLMs in mainstream RS tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval (TBIR), VQA, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we analyze representative works and discuss research progress. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing works and provide possible directions for future development. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress of VLMs in RS (see Figure 1), and to inspire further research in this exciting and promising field.},

In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them.

  pages={102261-102273},
  abstract={In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.},

  abstract={Since the beginnings of computer technology, researchers have speculated about the possibility of building smart machines that could compete with human intelligence. Given the current pace of advances in artificial intelligence and neural computing, such an evolution seems to be a more concrete possibility. Many people now believe that artificial consciousness is possible and that, in the future, it will emerge in complex computing machines. However, a discussion of artificial consciousness gives rise to several philosophical issues: can computers think or do they just calculate? Is consciousness a human prerogative? Does consciousness depend on the material that comprises the human brain, or can computer hardware replicate consciousness? Answering these questions is difficult because it requires combining information from many disciplines including computer science, neurophysiology, philosophy, and religion. Further, we must consider the influence of science fiction, especially science fiction films, when addressing artificial consciousness. As a product of the human imagination, such works express human desires and fears about future technologies and may influence the course of progress. At a societal level, science fiction simulates future scenarios that can help prepare us for crucial transitions by predicting the consequences of significant technological advances. The paper considers robots in science fiction, the Turing test, computer chess and artificial consciousness.},

  abstract={Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.},

  abstract={Approximate computing is gaining traction as a computing paradigm for data analytics and cognitive applications that aim to extract deep insight from vast quantities of data. In this paper, we demonstrate that multiple approximation techniques can be applied to applications in these domains and can be further combined together to compound their benefits. In assessing the potential of approximation in these applications, we took the liberty of changing multiple layers of the system stack: architecture, programming model, and algorithms. Across a set of applications spanning the domains of DSP, robotics, and machine learning, we show that hot loops in the applications can be perforated by an average of 50% with proportional reduction in execution time, while still producing acceptable quality of results. In addition, the width of the data used in the computation can be reduced to 10-16 bits from the currently common 32/64 bits with potential for significant performance and energy benefits. For parallel applications we reduced execution time by 50% using relaxed synchronization mechanisms. Finally, our results also demonstrate that benefits compounded when these techniques are applied concurrently. Our results across different applications demonstrate that approximate computing is a widely applicable paradigm with potential for compounded benefits from applying multiple techniques across the system stack. In order to exploit these benefits it is essential to re-think multiple layers of the system stack to embrace approximations ground-up and to design tightly integrated approximate accelerators. Doing so will enable moving the applications into a world in which the architecture, programming model, and even the algorithms used to implement the application are all fundamentally designed for approximate computing.},

  abstract={Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.},

abstract = {During the UnboxingCT project summer professional development, the Integrated CT Assessment was piloted with 72 elementary teachers. The assessment is based on computational thinking integration literature and asks teachers to identify different computational thinking concepts in content area scenarios. The assessment allowed us to identify which computational thinking concepts teachers were most familiar with prior to the professional development and assess changes in their understanding following the professional development. Our next step will be validation of the assessment with a larger group of teachers.},

Many studies use self-regulated learning to foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple observation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies share many features (and have some differences), which would support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learning be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features of self-regulated learning competencies.},

To provide an immersive experience, in this paper, we propose VRCoding, a Virtual Reality (VR)-based block coding system. VRCoding can teach computational thinking in an immersive Virtual Reality environment, exploiting passive haptics to improve interaction and give tactile feedback to the users. Passive haptics is obtained using simple physics placeholders, i.e., textured parallelepipeds, that are tracked in real-time, and aligned with the coding blocks in VR.  
The system is tested on a group of secondary school users, performing simple coding exercises with a standard monitor-based block coding environment and with the proposed VRCoding block language. Results show positive feedback concerning the sense of presence and the user experience.},

This keynote talk presents how ML technology upends the computational thinking (CT) consensus in computing education. It begins by presenting why and how a number of classical “CT1.0” concepts need to be re-thought for the “CT2.0” (machine learning) era, from control structures and problem-solving workflow, to correctness and notional machines. Based on a series of classroom interventions on teaching machine learning to middle schoolers, conducted by DIGS RC at University of Eastern Finland, the talk also presents how classroom pedagogy shifts between CT1.0 and CT2.0.},

abstract = {Computer Programming (CP) is difficult to teach and learn. Many students who enroll in CP courses have difficulty learning to program, as they have deficits in problem-solving skills and are unable to understand abstract programming concepts. Some studies also state that teaching methods are often not the most appropriate as they are not personalized to each student’s needs and do not complement their learning styles. We believe that Computational Thinking (CT) can help alleviate the difficulties in learning to program, especially if it is developed from an early age. However, it is also crucial that teachers use effective methods to help their students develop CT skills. There are several Learning Resources (LR) (digital or paper format) to develop CT skills, however, we argue that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the effectiveness of these LR in the teaching and learning process. The evidence about the brain’s learning process can be transformed into principles applicable in Education (Neuroeducation). To understand how we could train CT at various levels of education we built an ontology, OntoCnE, that describes the CT and CP domains. OntoCnE is composed of 3 layers that define: how to develop CT; which concepts should be taught at each level of education; and appropriate training materials. This paper aims to present a CT development approach based on this ontology together with Neuroeducation guidelines. The result of our research is the fourth layer for OntoCnE, which defines the Neuroeducation guidelines to characterize the materials. To illustrate our proposal, we will use LR PathIt as a case study. This approach can contribute to innovative and more efficient training of CT.},

Yet, the needs of neurodivergent children have remained largely overlooked in the extensive research and technologies built to foster CT among children. To address this, we investigated how to support neurodiverse (i.e., groups involving neurodivergent and neurotypical) preschoolers aged 3-5 in learning CT concepts. Grounded in interviews with six teachers, we deployed an age-appropriate, programmable robot called KIBO in two preschool classrooms involving 12 neurodivergent and 17 neurotypical children for eight weeks. Using interaction analysis, we illustrate how neurodivergent children found enjoyment in assembling KIBO and learned to code with it while engaging in cooperative and competitive play with neurotypical peers and the adults. Through this, we discuss accessible adaptations needed to enhance CT among neurodivergent preschoolers and ways to reimagine technology-mediated social play for them.},

While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

Challenges included students seeking direct answers or pasting feedback without considering suggested strategies. We discuss how instructors should integrate LLMs into assessments to support students' learning of CT.},

abstract = {The Technovation Girls program (TG) is an after-school program, where teams of female school students follow a software ideation process to address one of the UN's Sustainable Development goals. Concretely, they prototype a mobile application which they later pitch to judges. The TG curriculum gives students the tools they need to carry out this challenge, with activities focusing on entrepreneurship, product ideation and pitching, as well as coding. Previous evaluations of this program have focused on student and mentor perceptions and attitudes, collected through surveys, observation, focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we evaluate the effect that the coding part of the TG curriculum has on students' computational thinking skills, specifically in Chile, where the TG curriculum was expanded to a year to account for differences in the school curriculum. Also, in this experience, the TG program was carried out during class hours, and at both single- and mixed-gender vocational high schools. We applied an existing computational thinking test to the 2020 cohort (approx. 1000 students), before and after participating in the program, analyzing the results by school, gender and age. We found a slight improvement in test scores, with a more positive effect in male students.},

abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) stands as a universal problem-solving approach applicable across diverse disciplines, transcending the domain of computer science. It embodies the mental process of structuring a problem to enable a computational solution feasible for both humans and machines. This methodology involves dissecting problems into smaller parts that are easier to understand and solve. This study delineates a meticulously designed series of CT activities within an introductory computer science course and explores their profound impact on student engagement and problem-solving proficiency. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hands-on CT practice in augmenting students' ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, and abstract complexities, and employ algorithms effectively. Notably, this infusion of CT not only cultivates theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and real-world application through the use of computational tools like Python programming. As CT continues to emerge as a cornerstone skill in diverse domains, this research presents compelling evidence advocating for its integration into introductory courses, laying a robust foundation for students to navigate the evolving technological landscape with enhanced problem-solving capabilities.},

abstract = {The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.},

Preparing preservice teachers to teach CS is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for CS education. This experience report presents a CT/CS module initiative designed to prepare secondary preservice science and math teachers to teach CT/CS through an instructional methods course that integrates instructional practice within an elementary after-school program. This initiative employs the preservice teacher preparation framework that includes the observe-practice-reflect cycle. Within this framework, the preservice teachers began with incorporating unplugged lessons and then transitioned to robotics to teach CT/CS concepts. In this experience report, we detail the design and implementation of this CT/CS module initiative and share findings that revealed the preservice teachers' increased confidence, adaptations in lesson planning, and the challenges faced in teaching CT/CS. These takeaways aim to inspire and inform other teacher educators and practitioners working to prepare the next generation of CS teachers.},

abstract = {Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.},

abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15\% and 78\% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.},

This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.},

However, coding activities are predominantly sedentary in front of the screen, and the application of physical play in Computer Science education is less explored, e.g., how can we engage in computational thinking (CT) through physical play? In this design-based exploration, we conducted three design activities where young children, college students, and researchers were invited to create physical play projects using the BBC micro:bit and reflect on their experiences. By examining participants’ projects and creating processes, we provide empirical evidence that remixing physical play activities with coding can engage learners in various CT concepts and practices, reveal how CT concepts and practices can be represented in physical play, and highlight implications for designing physical play-mediated computational learning experiences. Ultimately, we encourage more learning experiences to incorporate physical play into computing education for children.},

Bebras tasks are logical puzzles created to introduce, practice and sometimes assess Computational Thinking (CT) skills. We use the think-aloud method to investigate the problem-solving process of participants with advanced CT skills. The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, the study examines how the use of CT skills manifests itself in the problem-solving process. By examining the thought process of participants, our study provides a detailed operationalization of CT skill definitions that could be used in subsequent studies to investigate the use of the skills. Secondly, the study provides a validation of the classification of a selection of Bebras tasks. Our results show that the skills assigned to these Bebras are indeed the skills most often used by the problem solvers while solving the tasks. Finally, even though the skills are used, the results also show that this does not always translate into answering these puzzles correctly. Based on the results we therefore conclude that, without looking at the problem-solving process, the tasks may not be suitable for the assessment of CT skills.},

abstract = {The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.},

abstract = {The aim of the doctoral thesis is to model an automated computational thinking (CT) assessment system based on solving processes of the interactive tasks. Currently, a literature review and analysis has been carried out, which has shown that among current CT assessment tools most popular ones still remain different types of tests. A study, comparing the two computational thinking assessment tests has been conducted and it has been observed that using only the tests causes data loss as tests do not collect information on the solution processes. An experiment was carried out to collect and analyze action information while solving the task and using this data to extract the possible different solution methods of an interactive task.},

This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.},

abstract = {This article presents research conducted within the School of Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence (EPCIA in its original form in Spanish) project, an initiative developed by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training during the 2020-21 academic year. The study investigated whether it is possible to contribute to the development of students’ computational thinking skills and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy through programming activities using the Scratch language and the Machine Learning for Kids platform. The study involved 133 teachers and more than 2,000 students, from 4th to 8th grade, with representation from 17 of the 19 Spanish regions. Students took a quantitative test on computational thinking and another on AI before and after the intervention, and teachers and students also took a questionnaire at the end of it. The results showed that: i) quantitative tests can be used to reliably measure, in terms of internal consistency, the level of development of computational thinking and AI literacy in the Spanish school population of these ages; ii) it is possible to develop students’ computational thinking skills and raise their level of AI literacy through programming activities; iii) the intervention contributed to demystifying the main prejudices regarding AI; iv) a gender gap was found in relation to previous knowledge and experiences with these topics. Overall, the study concluded that introducing the foundations of AI in primary and secondary education in Spain is appropriate, feasible, and relevant.},

abstract = {Programming integration into K-12 curricula has become increasingly important in the rapidly evolving educational landscape. Recognizing the need to develop computational thinking among young learners, this study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom approach on computational thinking in K-12 programming courses in Macao, focusing on primary school students' experiences with block-based programmable hardware. Employing a mixed methods research design, it combined quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine how flipped classroom activities—centered around student engagement with material through e-books, videos, and interactive classroom tasks—affected students' understanding and application of computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Quantitative data were collected using the Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS), and qualitative insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated significant improvements in students' computational concepts and practices, attributed to the advantages of self-study and a stratified approach to task complexity. However, advancements in computational perspectives were less pronounced, highlighting the need for more opportunities for students to refine their presentation skills. The study concluded that the flipped classroom approach, especially with tools like mBlock and Codey-Rocky, effectively nurtured computational thinking in primary school programming courses. It underscored the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing students' ability to apply programming concepts in problem-solving and suggested areas for further improvement in educational practices.},

We conducted a qualitative case study on curricular implementation in a general education classroom with large numbers of students designated as English learners. Results from detailed field notes revealed that the strategic application of instructional practices was implemented in the service of building on students' existing literacy skills to teach CT concepts and dispositions. The CT and literacy framework put forth in this study can be used as an analytic framework to highlight how instructional strategies mobilize the existing literacy and CT resources of linguistically diverse students.

However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python.This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment.Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is essential for the 21st century learner. Yet, assessing CT remains challenging. This is particularly challenging in constructionist learning, where individual idiosyncrasies may clash with one-size-fits-all assessments. Tools like Dr. Scratch offer CT metrics that show promise for effective and scalable CT assessments, particularly in constructionist game-based learning (GBL). Prior work has advanced the design of automated CT metrics but hardly included teachers in the process. We extend Dr. Scratch to improve automated CT assessments for GBL and put teachers in the loop to assess its novel features. Specifically, we interviewed seven middle school teachers employing GBL in STEM curricula and asked them to provide feedback on the newly designed CT metrics. Teachers view the new CT metrics positively, underscoring their potential for adaptive CT assessments despite hindrances. We advance automated CT assessments via teacher evaluation toward design-sensitive CT metrics and CT for all.},

Built upon the existing framework of Snap! (University of California, Berkeley), TuneScope leverages sound analysis, design, and music composition to engage novices with CT fundamentals. Existing research shows the benefits of using familiar contexts to teach CT, and TuneScope builds upon this with musical contexts. We have designed a course centered around the use of TuneScope to teach fundamentals of CT through music. In this paper, we investigate how students use TuneScope to develop sequential melodies, build chords, and sample recorded sounds while simultaneously learning fundamental programming principles such as algorithm design and abstraction. Using sentiment analysis, we demonstrate that students have had a largely positive experience in learning and grasping CT fundamentals throughout a diverse curriculum. As of today, the total enrollment of the course consists of over 45\% female students with a 100\% retention rate. TuneScope has also been accepted as an official Snap! library to be used by thousands of Snap! users worldwide.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need for computer science education opportunities and particularly for engaging students in computational thinking ideas and practices to help them understand how computing influences our world. At its core, computational thinking (CT) is seen as understanding how computational practices (such as, abstraction) and tools (such as modeling software) can be used to explore phenomena, solve problems, and influence our lives and society. The push for CT integration has called for preparing future educators to learn CT practices and tools through stand-alone courses and within the context of disciplinary pedagogy/methods courses. However, there are few instruments that measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computational thinking and its role in formal schooling. In this study, we developed and validated an instrument to measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards CT, its role in students' lives, and their own self-efficacy to incorporate CT into their teaching. We report results from a principal components factor analysis on survey responses from 260 pre-service teachers to identify patterns and reduce the number of dimensions of comparison in the analysis. We discuss how pre-service teacher conceptions have implications for preparing future teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has become one of the key literacies necessary for talents in the digital and intelligent era of the 21st century. In the current educational environment, the content of the curriculum that is detached from reality and the fragmented knowledge have brought great difficulties to the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability. Contextual teaching can connect knowledge with reality. Through the e-learning platform combined with real-life scenarios to build a specific real situation, which can drive students to carry out rich thinking activities. Therefore, this study designed a blended contextual teaching model for the development of computational thinking based on contextual learning theory and constructivist learning theory. It was applied to the teaching of high school information technology courses, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by investigating and analyzing whether there were changes in students' academic performance and computational thinking ability under the blended contextual teaching model through the questionnaire survey method and the experimental research method. The results of the study show that the application of the model can effectively improve students' academic performance and computational thinking ability, which provides an effective reference and reference for future educational teaching practice.},

abstract = {Pair programming is a collaborative activity that enhances students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Analyzing students’ interactions during pair programming provides valuable insights into effective learning. However, interpreting classroom dialogues is a challenging and complex task. Due to the simultaneous interaction between interlocutors and other ambient noise in collaborative learning contexts, previous work heavily relied on manual transcription and coding, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in speech and language processing offer promising opportunities to automate and scale up dialogue analysis. Besides, previous work mainly focused on task-related interactions, with little attention to social interactions. To address these gaps, we conducted a four-week CT course with 26 fifth-grade primary school students. We recorded their discussions, transcribed them with speech processing models, and developed a coding scheme and applied LLMs for annotation. Our AI-driven pipeline effectively analyzed classroom recordings with high accuracy and efficiency. After identifying the dialogue patterns, we investigated the relationships between these patterns and CT performance. Four clusters of dialogue patterns have been identified: Inquiry, Constructive Collaboration, Disengagement, and Disputation. We observed that Inquiry and Constructive Collaboration patterns were positively related to students’ CT skills, while Disengagement and Disputation patterns were associated with lower CT performance. This study contributes to the understanding of how dialogue patterns relate to CT performance and provides implications for both research and educational practice in CT learning.},

Twenty participants,aged between 7 and 9 years old, undertook the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt) as a pre-test, took part in three dance related workshops then completed the BCTt as post-test and responded to an adapted version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). Student performance on the BCTt improved significantly from pre-test to post-test for both boys and girls and seems generalised across the computational categories measured by BCTt. The study did not show a correlation between performance and motivation in girls but suggests that there may be some correlation between improvement in score and reported enjoyment in boys.},

abstract = {We propose a motor control-based characterization of how computational thinking (CT) can emerge from embodied performance. The account is based on children's activity during a tangible coding task, and a mechanism proposed by cognitive and motor neuroscience studies. For the task, the child used navigational symbols (forward, backward, rotate right, rotate left) to program the movements of a tangible robot on a 2-D grid. We propose that the development of CT through this task can be understood in terms of “tool incorporation into the body schema.” To illustrate the proposed mechanism, we use video data from one of three teaching sessions, where a group of four kindergartners learned to code using Cubetto (a tactile screen-free grid-based robotic toy). We argue that learning the task (i.e. being able to control Cubetto to perform goal-oriented movements) is challenging because the CT task requires learners to bridge three distinct discontinuities (spatial, temporal, and representational), to achieve control over the robot. We hypothesize that learners and facilitators are likely to engage in moves (both epistemic and pedagogical) that help bridge these gaps, and thus support the incorporation of the robot and its controller into the body schema. We characterize two such moves and explicate how they might support the incorporation process. The study is part of a larger program of design-based research aimed at helping young children develop CT.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has been identified as an important skill for children to learn in the 21st century, and many innovative kits and tools have been developed to integrate it into children’s learning. Yet, most solutions require the use of devices like computers or other expensive hardware, thus being inaccessible to low-income schools and communities. We present Cartoonimator, a low-cost, paper-based computational kit for children to create animations and engage with computational thinking. Cartoonimator requires only paper and a smartphone to use, offering an affordable learning experience. Children can draw the scenes and characters for their animation on the paper, which is printed with computer vision markers. We developed the mobile web app to provide an interface to capture keyframes and compile them into animations. In this paper, we describe the implementation and workflow of Cartoonimator, its deployment with children at a local STEAM event, and a planned evaluation for the kit.},

Our study analyzed 124 (62 males, 62 females) Scratch projects on the Scratch website, categorized projects on the basis of each user's gender and project type, and compared their Computational Thinking scores. The results of this study suggest that project types preferred by males require more programming construct reflected in the Computational Thinking score than that of females. Because gender differences appear by project type, project type presumably influences the gender gap in scores.},

abstract = {Cultivating students' computational thinking skills is one of the important teaching goals of college computer courses, and constructing a scientific and effective structural framework for computational thinking is the basis for implementing computational thinking training. To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course "Software Development Technology". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills are increasingly integrated into K-8 school curricula worldwide. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.},

Findings indicate PPPs with feedback and without distractors limit CL, those with feedback produce highest CT motivation, and those with an isolated block palette and without distractors produce highest CT learning efficiency.

abstract = {Due to the increasingly computational nature of professions, computational thinking (CT) is of growing importance to authentic science learning and the education of future scientists. To meet this need, CT integration is expanding within classrooms. We provided professional development (PD) for pre-service and in-service teachers focused on integrating CT into elementary science. At the PD culmination, 36 teachers wrote and enacted 22 unique CT-integrated science lessons, individually or with teaching partners. Waterman et al. (2020) suggested three levels of integrating CT within lesson plans: exist, labeling already present CT; enhance, adding CT components; and extend, adding activities supporting science learning with CT. Using this framework, we examined these lesson plans, their alignment to CT practices, and the level of CT integration. Our results indicated 83.3\% of teachers successfully integrated CT within their lessons, focusing on Using Data, Computational Simulations, and Programming practices. Further, we found the level of integration differed by CT practice. Data practices generally led to exist level integration, Computational Simulation practices to enhance level integration, and Programming practices tended to extend science lessons or exhibit the science topic with Programming. Our data demonstrated teachers can write CT-integrated lesson plans, but all levels of integration are not equal opportunities for authentic scientific learning. As the field seeks to offer equitable and quality CT experiences for all students integrated within disciplinary subjects, we must understand the level of CT integration and consider how different levels of integration could affect opportunities for students.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.},

Nonetheless, scientific literature on both topics has rarely focused on developing frames of reference that offer incorporation of the interweaving of these skills. The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the relationship between CT and DL in a framework where technology is used for education, with the end goal of designing a conceptual proposal that shows its common elements. The result is an initial proposal of interweaving that addresses skills such as abstraction (critical/cognitive-informational-communication), algorithm design (critical/cognitive-informational), and communication as common components, among others. We concluded that this proposal must be discussed, broadened, and considered as an initial reference framework for further analyses and delving into the topic.},

abstract = {With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.},

abstract = {In this poster, we will present approaches and associated design principles for integrating computational thinking (CT) into middle school Social Studies, Arts, and Language Arts instruction to enhance disciplinary learning. We used four steps to identify these approaches and design principles: (1) co-design with teachers and experts in computer science and CT education to ideate CT-integrated lessons; (2) identifying initial design principles based on the ideated lessons; (3) consultation with subject matter experts; and (4) conducting a Delphi study with pedagogical experts (e.g., teachers, curriculum writers, teacher educators) to examine the clarity, feasibility and potential impact of the design principles. The process led to three broad approaches to integrate CT into Social Studies instruction that included 14 design principles, three for Arts with 16 design principles, and four for Language Arts with 12 design principles.},

abstract = {Nature connection fosters children's healthy development, and long-term sustainable behaviours. Most research into children-nature connection has focused on positive experiences. However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre. We found that computational thinking is evident in children's outdoor nature play and that HCI research could undertake design to further enhance their computational thinking skills outdoors. This can add value to their learning by harnessing their interest, understanding and connection, and by introducing children to environmental problem-solving.},

abstract = {Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.},

We present the exploration of a craftsmanship-driven approach to engage people in CT. To explore this approach a team of knitters, a computer scientist and a computing education expert iteratively designed the KnitxCode workshop. KnitxCode utilises knitting in combination with CT concepts as the foundation for the activities. The workshop was evaluated by 12 participants with no programming experience and with knitting experience ranging from 2-25 years (M = 6). From the evaluation we found that the craftsmanship-driven approach seemed to provide the participants with confidence to learning CT, as shared concepts and practices between knitting and computing supported transitioning from knitting craftsmanship to computing and in this way served to demystify computing.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a highly contentious subject with many diverging meanings and definitions. This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives. This paper proposes to put these three (+1) perspectives in dialogue, in an effort to support researchers and practitioners working with CT across different fields.},

However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design. The study revealed new kinds of educational potential of 3D printing including the understanding of complex mathematical and CT ideas that were too complicated before, and the connection of CT practices with real-world problems through the implementation of a Design Thinking project with digital media.},

The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},

We build a student model by extracting meaningful student behaviors on real-world interaction data obtained during interaction in online classrooms and including expert insights. We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data. Lastly, we get insights into the value of these help interventions by empirically evaluating the IPA in a formal user study.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.},

This study shares the design of new pedagogy for CS1 that removes dependency on a particular language and promotes computational thinking by teaching multiple programming languages simultaneously. Specifically, chosen programming languages range from low-level to high-level to expose students to different levels of abstraction from the details of computer architecture.

An acceptable level of internal consistency was found (Cronbach's alpha=0.70). We examined the validity of the test using Classical Test Theory. One question showed poor discrimination potential. Its elimination from the test increased the internal consistency, so we propose to replace it.},

abstract = {Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

abstract = {The research aims to analyze the impact of games on the development of computational thinking in students, specifically the digital card game called Moon (a card game where the computer of the Eagle lunar module is controlled during the first moon landing). The methodology applied is experimental where a series of learning sessions applying the virtual game Moon is applied to a sample of 25 students selected through a simple random sampling of a population of 100 students, we proceed to evaluate the students through a pre-test and post-test. The results show that the application of the virtual game Moon significantly influences the increase of Computational Thinking in students, which was demonstrated by applying the evaluation and observing how they overcame the different challenges proposed through the different difficulties of the virtual game Moon, this developed in the competence of "Design and build technological solutions to solve problems in their environment".},

However, there is very little guidance for effective approaches to integrating CT consistently and cohesively school wide. CT Readiness for All is a two-year research project that is investigating a CT framework and self-assessment tool developed to articulate indicators associated with successful school-wide integration across elementary curricula. Data sources include focus group interviews and surveys with teachers. Although the project is still in progress, early analysis have resulted in three key findings: (a) students were able to make cross-curricular connections using CT as a problem-solving process; (b) finding time within the school day to focus on CT is challenging; and (c) administrators need to take an active role in setting the vision and definition of CT to support school-wide CT efforts.},

To promote and assess students’ CT skills, so-called ’Bebras tasks’ (i.e. small tasks for problem solving in informatics) are created by experts in the field of CT. There has not been empirical research to determine to what extent and how CT skills are used while solving these tasks, however. This qualitative study bridges this gap by using the think-aloud method to examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras. The results of this study can serve as a validation for the use of CT skills in solving Bebras tasks. This poster abstract introduces the background and setup of the study.},

This study takes a look at how students from interdisciplinary backgrounds interact using gestures and use CT to understand matrix math concepts in a group setting. A mixed-methods analysis is used to gain insight into how students’ practice CT. Data collected from pre- and post- assessments measures students’ mastery level in matrix math concepts.

abstract = {Due to the proliferation of technology in daily life and the growing number of ways in which humans and machines interact, the process of designing interactive elements has become critical. Nevertheless, design students are seldom able to design and implement interactive elements because of their limited programming skills. Although there have been some approaches to teach computational thinking using physical computing and focusing on solving real-world problems (e.g., electronic devices such as Arduino, using sensors and actuators), they often entail monetary expenses and require knowledgeable instructors, and are not catered to students without prior programming or electronics knowledge. Hence, we propose the use of Protobject, a low-cost tool that focuses on real-world applications that could be used to teach programming to design students. This study aims to evaluate students’ perceptions regarding the usability of Protobject as a tool for learning computational thinking, as well as the clarity of the learning activities designed to teach computational thinking concepts by using Protobject.},

We focus on elementary social studies, specifically a third grade geography lesson on absolute location using a teaching strategy of a scaffolded geocache. We present a selection of computational thinking elements, adapt them to social studies, and then organize them into a four-part heuristic: Data, Patterns, Rules, and Questions. Through this selection, adaptation, and sequencing, computational thinking can become a relevant and accessible integrated concept within the elementary social studies curriculum.},

abstract = {In our modern society, technology has profoundly reshaped various aspects of our lives, influencing the way we work, communicate, and interact. This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences. In summary, the study outlines a trajectory where students and educators skillfully navigate the complexities of contemporary paradigms},

In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.},

Despite the availability of various tools to assess CT, there is a notable scarcity of tools designed for evaluating CT practices in lower elementary students. To address this gap, this study develops a digital game titled "Magical Adventure" based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, which aimed at assessing the CT practices of young children. The game comprises five scenarios, targeting five CT practices respectively, including pattern recognition, abstraction, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and debugging. Scoring criteria were designed to evaluate students' CT abilities based on the anticipated gameplay process data. This study describes the design and development process of the game. Future steps will include validation of its effectiveness through expert reviews and cognitive interviews, followed by empirical research to optimize and refine the game, enhancing its accuracy in reflecting students' CT practices.},

abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on education has opened new doors and accelerated change, and a learning opportunity has emerged towards the digital transformation of teaching models. Computing acquires a new relevance and fits into the plan to strengthen digital skills as a driver of digital knowledge, particularly relevant for children and young people. In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children's expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience. The educational toolkit and base literature review are discussed, and the early prototypes of the programming language proposed are presented, as well as the ongoing and future work. With this initial work it was possible to conclude that computer programming has many benefits in fostering CT in children, alongside other cognitive skills, as well as the importance of stimulating children's expression and communication that are transversal to all areas of life. Therefore, computer programming will be used and incorporated in Mobeybou in order to achieve the research aims proposed in this paper and promote children's expression through CT development.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is seen as a crucial skill in an increasingly digital society. Researchers and educators in higher education therefore aim to improve the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of students using appropriate interventions. However, there is currently no overview of interventions used to teach CT and how effective they are. With this scoping literature review, we provide such an overview by identifying articles that discuss interventions used to teach CT in higher education. We identify the teaching approaches used in these interventions, and discuss their effectiveness and how this is assessed. Furthermore, we look at the use of adaptive interventions. Our search of three academic databases (Scopus, ACM and ERIC) resulted in 1839 articles. After screening, 49 articles remained. A detailed examination of the interventions discussed in these articles showed that CT is still often taught through programming assignments. The interventions are evaluated in a myriad of ways, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of interventions. We therefore suggest making use of more standardized instruments to evaluate the effectiveness. Finally, although scaffolding is applied, interventions are not often adapted to the actual proficiency level of a student.},

The main objective of the research plan is to propose a curricular approach of Computational Thinking (CT) competences through active methodologies in Primary Education classrooms. It is a study with a mixed methodology to obtain more detailed results; the quantitative phase consists of the development of a MOOC for teacher training in CT, evaluated through questionnaires, and the qualitative phase, a didactic proposal in which these competencies are developed, evaluated through interviews, or focus groups. Thus, we start from a state of the art where it is reflected, on the one hand, that teacher training in CT competences causes positive feedback in Primary Education classrooms and, on the other hand, the need to carry out this training and include CT, programming, and robotics in educational curricula.},

abstract = {There is growing attention for integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into various subjects across the K-12 curriculum with a concomitant increase of interest in investigating teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) regarding CT. This study is part of a bigger project focusing on defining the learning trajectories for CT integration into the K-12 curriculum. In particular, the present study focused on eliciting the pedagogical content knowledge and attitude of teachers with respect to the integration of CT in various disciplines. To this end, we implemented six different case studies by integrating CT into six different subjects: science, traffic, language, biology, geography, and physics. Two primary and four secondary school teachers were involved in the study. After the lesson series was completed in schools, we conducted interviews with teachers to understand their PCK on CT integration, attitudes toward CT integrated lessons, and the barriers teachers faced during CT integrated lessons. Our results indicate that compared to standard instructional activities, students can go deeper and understand the subject content better in CT integrated lessons, also students can use the power of digital technologies to solve subject-related problems. On the other hand, teachers pointed out that students and teachers need to be more capable of technical knowledge and skills to accomplish tasks.},

abstract = {This mixed methods study examined barriers faced by three elementary schools in their approaches to integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom instruction. Because CT is a relatively new instructional area, limited research guides CT integration, especially in bringing CT to academically, linguistically, and culturally diverse instruction. This study, therefore, examined challenges faced by teachers in bringing CT into their instructional practice. Data included interviews with 11 teachers and surveys of 46 teachers in a large, urban school district. The three schools in the district were part of a CS for All initiative in their school district. Data revealed common challenges: a) Limited CT teaching expertise; b) Limited time for CT integration; c) Lack of CT-specific assessment knowledge and tools; d) Limited pedagogical understanding for meeting students' diverse instructional needs; and e) Low teacher-buy-in for teaching CT. Our data also showed differences across schools in access to classroom implementation infrastructure such as technology and curricular resources, competing administrative priorities, and types of professional development opportunities. This study points to practical implications for supporting integration of CT in elementary contexts. Most notably, it is critical to proactively address these barriers in preservice and in-service teacher preparation as well as in school-wide infrastructure in order to have a sustained CT integration effort.},

A board game virtual interface was developed based on Unity-3D, and the corresponding device with a robotic arm was set up based on ESP32-CAM development board. The learning system enables a dual interaction mechanism by learning through Human-Machine Competition virtually or physically. By participating in the game, students faced challenges such as board game step reasoning, model abstract, decision-making, and strategic planning, thereby enhancing their computational thinking and problem-solving skills. Results indicated that the blended board game improve students’ overall computational thinking skills, especially reasoning, decision-making and strategic planning. This research provides an innovative approach to develop virtual-physical integrated game-based learning system for promoting students' computational thinking through human-machine competition.},

abstract = {Teacher education programs are beginning to acknowledge the important role they play in preparing teachers to support students in the area of STEM, coding, Computational Thinking and robotics. As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context. The researchers will be further studying the pre-service teacher experience and are looking to provide recommendations for other preservice teacher education programs as well as in-service professional development programs.},

Specifically, we present a standalone educational technology course with explicit attention on connecting CT to disciplinary content and pedagogy while introducing a range of digital tools. Data were collected from 34 pre-service teachers over the period of one semester. Specifically, a total of 68 lesson plans developed by pre-service teachers through two distinct lesson planning tasks using concept mapping and programming tools were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The analysis utilized a coding scheme that focused on identifying specific CT practices illustrated in each lesson. It also examined differences in the CT practices exhibited in each lesson planning task. Findings indicated that the CT practice of data was most prevalent in pre-service teachers' lesson plans. Outside of data, however, there was greater variation in the CT practices represented in programming lesson plans compared to the concept mapping lesson plans. Implications for teacher educators are discussed based on the findings.},

As CT can also be seen as a problem-solving process, not only the skills and strategies are an important part of CT, but also the attitudes of the problem solvers. These have already been described as persistence, dealing with complexity, ambiguity, and confidence. An important competence for future computer science teachers is to confidently guide students’ problem-solving process. This work presents preliminary results on the relationship between pre-service computer science teachers’ CT attitudes and their performance on Python tasks. Therefore, N=19 pre-service computer science teachers solved three tasks in Python and rated their attitudes towards solving the tasks. However, the preliminary results only allow to draw tentative and interpretative conclusions.},

Students learn principles of abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking; no coding experience is required. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that students are learning and applying computational thinking principles. Since the course is designed and taught by a musician and is run in the music department, students also learn a significant amount of music theory and composition, including harmonic structures and harmonization principles, melodic organization, consonance and dissonance, aural analysis of formal structures and meter, and influence of rhythm and timbre to create desired sounds.},

abstract = {Linking sustainable development with computational thinking promotes high-impact problem solving, integrating fundamental concepts of computer programming. This study analyzed the relationship between computational thinking and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using text mining and data visualization techniques. A text mining method was employed to analyze computational thinking and its sub-competencies (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm) appearances in the OSDG Community dataset, consisting of 32,120 text fragments labeled with the associated SDG. Results revealed that computational thinking and its subcompetencies: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm, were frequently linked to SDGs 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The findings demonstrate the potential of computational thinking to provide innovative solutions to global problems and support the achievement of the SDGs. The study can be of value to stakeholders in the social, governmental, academic and business sectors interested in sustainable development and educational innovation in the application of computational thinking.},

abstract = {With a focus on problem resolution, Computational Thinking (CT) can assist in developing cognitive abilities. A way to work with CT is using educational digital games (EDG), a ludic tool that stimulates the students’ learning. Still, adjustments are needed so that students with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) can use these games. Based on this scenario, we presented a Bachelor’s final paper that envisioned the creation of an EDG, aiming to contribute to the learning of the target audience, based on the promotion of the development of CT. Called “Pensar e Vestir”, the game uses the four pillars of CT by addressing choosing and wearing clothes. For that, the development counted with a multidisciplinary group – stakeholders and specialists from the areas of Computer Science, Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and ID – and followed the Simple Interaction Design lifecycle model, with the definition of requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation. As a result, this EDG has two phases and eight situations each: time to sleep, the school in the heat, school in the cold, costume, park, tour, teacher, and market. The game was evaluated by specialists, Computing students, and one neurotypical child, we also intend to make a large evaluation with the target audience. As an outcome, the interaction design process with different stakeholders and specialists provides different insights and improvements to the game. Also, the game is accessible to neurotypical and with ID students.},

This is partly due to the fact that on the one hand, many first year students possess only moderate abstract thinking skills, while on the other hand, Computer Science lecturers often take the existence of abstract thinking skills for granted, as they themselves are well versed in this area. To bridge this gap and foster the students’ abstract thinking skills, we employ haptic material to make abstract tasks and the corresponding solution processes more tangible. This supports the development of abstract thinking skills, and at the same time helps to actively engage students in our classes on software development. In this paper we describe our experiences with active classroom learning units based on haptic materials, as part of our inverted classroom teaching.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.},

In this paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial connections between individual design patterns present in video games and computational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to elicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an effective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming education more effective.},

And since CT has been formalized only recently, many existing boardgames unknowingly might support aspects of CT. To help educators and game practitioners navigate this complex landscape, we analyze a selected sample of analog games, and propose to categorize their features with respect to CT concepts and practices. The main contribution of this paper is a novel way to identify potential CT-relevant games, that leverages on the authors’ experience with digital and analog games, playful and game-based learning. Although limited, this approach appears promising and practical for CT teachers and game designers interested in adapting existing games to the classroom or developing better CT-supporting boardgames.},

abstract = {The Louisiana Department of Education partnered with the Gordon A. Cain Center at LSU to pilot a Computing High School Graduation Pathway. The first course in the pathway, Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT), is designed to teach programming and reinforce mathematical practice skills of nine-grade students, with an emphasis on promoting higher order thinking. In 2017-18, about 200 students and five teachers participated in the pilot, in 2018-2019 the participation increased to 400 students, and in the current 2019-2020 year about 800 students in 11 schools are involved. After describing the course content and the teacher training, we briefly discuss the data we have collected in the last two years. The overall student reception of the course has been positive, but the course was categorized by most students as hard. The pre-post test content assessments show that students have learned not only the language, but also general principles of programming. Lessons learned during the pilot phase have motivated changes, such as emphasizing during Professional Development the need to provide timely feedback to students, provide detailed rubrics for the projects and reorganize the lessons to increase the initial engagement with the material. After two years of running pilots, the course is becoming student-centered, where most of the code and image samples provided in the lessons are based on code created by previous students.},

abstract = {There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

abstract = {The momentum around computational thinking (CT) has kindled a rising wave of research initiatives and scholarly contributions seeking to capitalize on the opportunities that CT could bring. A number of literature reviews have showed a vibrant community of practitioners and a growing number of publications. However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.},

abstract = {In the information age, online teaching will gradually become an inevitable trend in the era of modern education informatization. Online teaching has the advantages of easy operation and abundant resources, but it has higher requirements for the design of teaching mode and teaching content. Computational thinking, as the core idea of IT teaching, emphasizes the long-term development and deep development of IT learning, which has great practical significance for students to improve themselves and cultivate their ability development. So in the online teaching of high school IT courses, how to build an online teaching mode suitable for students' development and achieve the purpose of effectively cultivating students' computational thinking? This study combines specific teaching, guided by constructivist theory, nearest developmental zone theory, situational cognition and other theories, and uses literature research method, questionnaire survey method, quasi-experimental research method and other research methods to conduct a study on the construction and validation of online teaching model of high school information technology geared to the cultivation of computational thinking. The results of the study showed that the proposed teaching model was found to have a significant promotion effect on students' academic performance and computational thinking through the examination of students' academic performance and computational thinking.},

abstract = {Variable is a common computer science (CS) concept and is being introduced to upper elementary students in computational thinking (CT)-integrated instruction. However, there is scant empirical evidence of when and how elementary students should learn variables. For example, national computer science (CS) standards advise introducing variables in grades 3-5 and a K-8 variable learning trajectory (LT) synthesized learning goals from the literature and hypothesized four levels of thinking in working with variables. Yet, little empirical research lies behind these. This mixed methods study examined elementary students' understanding of variables. Participants were sampled from two fourth-grade classes from a Midwestern elementary school that implemented a series of CT-integrated math lessons. Students' written responses to variables assessment items were analyzed. Additionally, cognitive think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine students to elicit students' understanding while solving the variables assessment items. Our findings suggested that most students lacked a conceptual understanding of using variables to create generalized problem solutions that could work with any set of inputs. Additionally, students had difficulty with specific mechanics of using variables such as storing user input in a variable, updating variable values, and using the values stored in variables. This study underscores the need for careful design, use, and analysis of elementary CT-integrated lessons and assessments to introduce and reinforce the conceptual understanding and specific mechanics of variables for elementary students.},

abstract = {In this article I present a theoretical framework for the concept "computational thinking". I do so in response to some of the problems and consequences of the lack of viable theoretical foundations; especially in relation to the development in recent years of many educational practices that claim the term "computational thinking". I therefore introduce my extension of Jean Piaget's general law of cognition which arose as a result of my empirical research on novice learners knowledge of the concept of a program as an executable object. Said empirical study is briefly described in this paper as a means to highlight the key to my extension of Piaget's general law, which is the insight of how the thought processes and methods involved in cases where the subject must instruct an action to a computer differ from those in which the subject instructs another subject, or performs the action themselves. My theory explains the difference between algorithmic thinking and computational thinking by adequately locating it in the specificities of the subject instructing a computer. Hence, in this article I claim that my extension of Piaget's law offers a more empirically thorough and theoretically sound way forward in the conceptual development of "computational thinking" than the alternatives that are being debated in academia to the present day.},

Recent CT tests focus on programming skills rather than the analytical ability and problem-solving processes in science, philosophy and other areas of knowledge.  This poster presents the results (Test design) of an ongoing project that has developed a Psychometric Computational Thinking Test (PCTT) which has three phases: test design, test implementation and applying the test. In regards to the PCTT design, the reliability and validity of the test were based on content and construct validity which also includes its rating scales for its application.  This work makes two contributions: (1) a standardized CT Test design incorporating psychometric techniques as well as computational techniques and (2) the inclusion of open-ended questions and their assessment with V of Aiken in order to validate responses.},

We claim that practicing basic skills when exploring simple prototypes favors people to build mental models that are useful to understand and use technologies. In a case study, we engaged adults in their initial stages of literacy in activities that evolved from basic ones with a low fidelity ATM prototype to complex ones with a functional prototype. We identified that participants used the experience and knowledge they obtained from previous activities to carry out the next ones, showing confidence and autonomy when exploring a functional prototype.},

abstract = {The worldwide push for computing education at younger ages requires that teachers are prepared to deliver instruction that supports all learners. Other discipline-based education research fields offer a wealth of instructional scaffolds worthy of exploration in computing. One such scaffold drawn from math education is diagramming. While diagrams are frequently employed in university computing, little is known about its applications in K-8 (ages 6-14) computing.To inform diagram design for K-8 computing, we investigated how the spatial orientation of a diagram (horizontal or vertical) influenced the extent to which K-8 teachers developed different technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) of computational thinking (CT) concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and decomposition. We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of events when using a vertical diagram. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe various CT concepts and aspects of TPACK, more teachers using a vertical diagram made connections between concepts, whereas more teachers using a horizontal diagram described concepts in isolation. We hope this exploration will spur future work into diagramming and more broadly, spatial reasoning in K-8 computing.},

abstract = {Today’s teaching and didactical methods are trying more and more to integrate digital technologies and computational thinking (CT) into other subjects. One way of combining and integrating these important skills and CT into all subjects, school levels, and school types is to include the game Poly-Universe (PolyUni). According to the results of the Poly-Universe in School Education (PUSE) study 2018, the game can be expected to have a positive effect on visual perceptual progress, including isolation and the development of shape-background skills. So far, however, comparatively few attempts have been made to explore the educational possibilities of PolyUni for different school levels and subjects, besides mathematics. This research explores how PolyUni can be used to promote CT and to evaluate whether the learning objectives in the subjects of physical education and biology have been achieved. Furthermore, it examines how PolyUni combines the requirements of the different curricula in secondary school, based on self-designed tasks. Additionally, further aspects PolyUni can promote besides the curriculum in secondary school are discussed. To explore the above-mentioned aspects, a mixed-methods study methodology was used. The participant observation method was employed for qualitative data collection, and a self-designed assessment grid and additional picture analysis were used for the quantitative data. The game was utilized in two workshops for biology and physical education at an Austrian secondary school, and fifty-six students were observed and analyzed. Based on the present data, it can be assumed that PolyUni helps to achieve the requirements of the curricula and pre-defined teaching and learning objectives in a playful way. Furthermore, the game not only promotes CT in secondary school but also encourages enjoyment and collaboration between peers in biology and physical education lessons.},

Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student competency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.},

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.},

abstract = {With the development of the era of artificial intelligence (AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of CT perspective can promote the growth of students ' connection ability, questioning ability and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ' CT perspective. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective of students in third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students, but the improvement of connection ability is not significant. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students ' computational identity.},

Preliminary results revealed a significant increase in participants' self-efficacy and sense of belonging in computing after the informal learning activity. Students were more focused on tasks when engaging socially with their peers and teachers. A decrease in misconception was observed in uni-structural knowledge but no significant difference was found in multi-structural computing knowledge acquisition.

abstract = {Programming and computational thinking (CT) have become important topics in elementary education and are being implemented by national curricula, extracurricular programs, and informal learning environments. Most related research and implementation is mainly focused on block-based programming (BBP). However, BBP can lead to bad programming habits and a later transition to text-based programming (TBP) has been shown to be difficult for students, as they can lose confidence and motivation. Thus, we developed a course to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP and foster CT while also promoting motivation and students’ programming-related self-concept. We considered data from 27 fourth-grade students aged 9 to 10, who participated in the course as part of an extracurricular enrichment program. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed CT and its cognitive correlates such as non-verbal visuospatial reasoning, verbal reasoning, arithmetic competencies as well as the student’s motivation and attitude towards programming. Results indicated improved students’ CT, arithmetic, and non-verbal visuospatial reasoning. Furthermore, the transition to TBP did not significantly reduce students’ motivation for programming. Taken together, these findings indicate that the developed intervention may be helpful to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP while keeping the students motivated and fostering CT.},

abstract = {This poster provides an overview of the goals and objectives of the New York City Department of Education's (NYCDOE) Hack League, a district-wide competition that invites middle and high school students with any level of CS experience to explore the systemic impacts and applications of computing. By requiring participants to interact with data and prototype a proposed solution to an issue that the data illuminates, students creatively engage in a human-centered design and strategic problem-solving process aimed at improving the quality of life and civic issues in their communities. Each stage of competition represents a component of the engineering design process, thereby encouraging students to be thoughtful programmers. Through three stages of competition, students identify an issue and validate it with data, outline and prototype a solution while incorporating feedback from industry professionals and subject matter experts, and build metrics into their product. Making open data accessible to students has proven to be an effective approach to developing citizen scientists in NYC. This competition could be replicated in districts anywhere in the country and can be organized within or across schools. It is a great way to encourage student development as civic-minded individuals, engagement with their local government and elected officials, and application of computational thinking and computer science skills.},

We present pilot instantiations of computational thinking integration in three different disciplines including sociology, mathematics and music. We also present our professional development approach, which is based on faculty support rather than a co-teaching model. Further, we discuss formative assessment during the pilot implementation, including data focusing on undergraduate students' understanding and dispositions towards computational thinking. Finally, we reflect on what worked, what did not work and why, and identify lessons learned. Our work is relevant to higher education institutions across the nation interested in preparing students who can utilize computational principles to address discipline-specific problems.},

In this study, we address two pertinent questions: (1) What types of artifacts do students develop across different disciplines in response to CT-driven problem prompts' and (2) What types of CT skills do these artifacts demonstrate? To answer the questions, we examined 273 artifacts developed by undergraduate students across seven course assignments from four disciplines: mathematics, sociology, music, and English using a rubric developed to evaluate the following CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking. We found that a range of skills were reflected across student artifacts.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking has become an important cognitive skill to develop in all areas of education. Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its subconstructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, fewbreak down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured.},

Researchers realize that the development of CT in students at the elementary and middle school levels not only enables earlier use of CT, but also can better solute the problems in their daily learning. This study investigated the impact of self-directed learning on the development of CT in a block-based programming course. Using Pre- and posttest quasi-experimental research method, 128 students from a middle school were selected. Through the CT skill scale, the CT self-efficacy scale, and semistructured interviews, the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed after four months of interventions. The findings revealed that the self-directed learning had a positive impact on middle school students’ CT skill and self-efficacy. Therefore, results revealed that self-directed learning is one of the effective learning strategies for developing CT of middle school students.},

It investigates digital storytelling as a way to integrate CT, analyzing its impact on students’ learning both of English and of CT, and on students’ attitudes toward the CT integrated English lesson. A class of 8th grade students (average age 13 years) participated in the study. The impact of the CT integrated lessons was investigated using students’ final products, surveys, rubrics, exit tickets and focus group interviews. The results suggest that the digital storytelling approach may improve students’ learning of English and of CT, and that it helped enhancing students’ creativity and collaboration, thus promoting their digital participation.},

In this paper, we present ExposAR – a collaborative cross-device AR system enabling children to create, use, and reflect on AR technologies through the co-creation of a simple AR application. With ExposAR, we explore three core design principles: 1) reify computational concepts, 2) support collaborative cross-device authoring, and 3) incorporate the user’s own world. These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR. With these results, we bring AR to the CT agenda and contribute novel design principles for exposing the underlying mechanisms and implications of AR.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as an important part of K-12 education in many countries and is often described in term relating to computer science both in concepts and context. However, the unique practice of computer scientists collaborating on problem solving is often overlooked in CT education in high school. We believe that collaboration is a key aspect of modern computing, and propose to integrate collaborative CT activities into existing high school education. The aim is to prepare students better for exploring computational approaches to high school disciplines as they are practiced in the professional world. Our research question is: how can we design tools for supporting students' collaboration while teaching CT in high school? A new computational environment, CoTinker, has been developed. The tool uses a cross-device approach and foster students' verbal communication and collaboration in groups. The tool was tested in a Biology class. Students' computational thinking (CT) was assessed through learning activities and students' communication was analyzed by audio recordings, of students, imbedded in CoTinker and by focus group interviews with students. Preliminary findings showed students being able to collaborate and solve CT tasks in groups independent of teacher or researchers. Results also indicated that students were able to use, navigate, and critically reflect upon the CoTinker environment.},

abstract = {Teachers new to computing who are not familiar with technical “jargon” can feel like they have landed in a foreign world, making them reluctant to take on the subject, and potentially leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings in the classroom. The diversity of technical words, metaphors, and phrases in different contexts can make their meanings confusing, ambiguous or misunderstood for the diverse user groups in computing education. Therefore, understanding the nature of the commonly claimed difficulties and confusion caused by computer jargon among teachers becomes important for finding ways to address this issue. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study conducted to understand the nature of teachers’ understanding of computational terms (jargon) related to Computational Thinking concepts, and how a relevant professional development intervention can help to resolve issues related to them. The results indicate that the nature of the teachers’ understanding of computational terms can be either that the computational meaning is not known, that the computational context is unclear, or their applicability is unclear. Concerns about teachers finding computer jargon difficult to understand can be because the computational context in which they are applied makes them difficult for teachers to understand, rather than not knowing their meanings in the first place. Moreover, appropriate support can enable teachers to learn the techniques and skills that the terminology refers to.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a means to help learners engage in authentic disciplinary and problem-solving practices of computer science (CS). For CS classrooms, CT is considered "thinking like a computer scientist". CT is believed to be an important learning goal of introductory CS in addition to CS concepts and programming. Despite the growing attention on CT in K-12 CS education, there is lingering confusion on the what and how of CT, and CT's relationship to coding and CS. Education research on disciplinary thinking skills in science and mathematics education can provide guidance for teaching and learning of CT. For example, (a) The shift in emphasis on disciplinary thinking helps focus on deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote learning of knowledge and facts. Hence thinking like a scientist, or mathematician, historian or computer scientist, draws attention to authentic practices of those disciplines. (b) Thinking skills are best taught in context. Therefore, CT should be taught in CS classrooms or integrated into learning of other subjects rather than taught as a separate skill or subject. (c) Even if there is no transfer beyond the context in which they are taught, a focus on thinking skills helps in deeper conceptual learning; (d) Like critical or creative thinking, CT should be integrated into other subjects to enrich learning. Research on meaningful technology integration across subjects provides useful frameworks to inform CT integration efforts. This talk aims to productively move the discourse on CT toward concrete ideas for K-12 educators, researchers, and curricular designers.},

Even though these are crucial areas in today’s world, they are only rarely taught in school and interventions that target these areas simultaneously are still very rare. We therefore developed a four-day workshop with the aim of fostering computational thinking and social-emotional skills in Grade 4 students. To do so, we used the child-friendly programming language Scratch. In the present paper, we investigate the feasibility of such a workshop. In total, 18 students participated. Data was collected via observation and interviews and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results showed that students liked working with Scratch and liked working on social-emotional challenges. The workshop was found to work well and students worked independently. Pair work activity was found to be particularly beneficial. Although some issues initially proved challenging (mostly relating to “how to” issues in Scratch), these may easily be addressed by making suitable adaptations to the introduction of the program provided on Day 1 of the workshop.},

Over the course of two years, we focused on teacher development in a large city school system via summer workshops that brought in-service and pre-service teachers together to co-create integrated CT lessons. In this experience report, we will describe the workshop design and share the perspectives of the participating K-5 teachers. One particular area of focus of the workshop was integrating 'plugged' or technology-based computing examples for the teachers. Further, we engaged the teachers with a discussion of the role of CT in promoting equity for students and demonstrated ways in which student cultural experiences could be activated through creative computing. Specific outcomes of the work included increased confidence and value in CT vocabulary usage, ideas to infuse existing curriculum with CT ideas, and teacher belief that CT could be used as a "gateway" for learning CS. We make recommendations for future efforts to include CT in pre-service teacher preparation.},

abstract = {Computer science education is more important than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our society's reliance on computing and its power to help businesses innovate and adapt, yet at the same time has surfaced greater disparities for students studying computer science. Computing is the number one source of all new wages in our economy, and there are currently 400,000 open computing jobs across the United States. However, unequal access to computer science instruction and opportunities to engage in computational thinking and practices remain prevalent (Google \&amp; Gallup, 2015). In the 2018-19 school year, only 15 percent of Maryland graduates took at least one computing related course, and there were significant gaps in the course taking patterns by gender and race (Maryland Center for Computing Education, 2021). To grow students' competencies with computational thinking and computer science, it is essential to build the capacity of teachers to integrate computational thinking competencies and standards into their practice. The Frostburg State University College of Education's Maryland Accelerates (MA) Program provides aspiring teachers the opportunity to earn an accelerated Master of Arts in Teaching (Elementary or Secondary track) degree along with an innovative yearlong teacher residency in partnership with Frederick and Garrett County Public Schools. One of the primary goals of the program is to integrate mathematical problem solving and computational thinking to promote scientific inquiry in partnering elementary and secondary schools. To this end, Frostburg State University has developed an exciting opportunity for Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) students to earn a microcredential in Computational Thinking that is aligned to the ISTE Educator Standards, the High Leverage Practice Standards from TeachingWorks, and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium InTASC Model as part of their teacher preparation program. In this panel, faculty from the Computer Science Department and the College of Education at Frostburg State University will discuss their partnership to develop a microcredential for Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers, how and why the credential was developed, and what competencies aspiring teachers develop. Two recent graduates of the Maryland Accelerates MAT Teacher Residency program will discuss their experience using these skills and knowledge during their residency and how they plan to apply and integrate computational thinking into their practice as new teachers.},

abstract = {As computing education begins to grow in K-12 classrooms, it is increasingly important to understand the relationships between a student's coding attitudes and computing outcomes. While work has been done at the undergraduate and high school level, less is known about elementary students, and even less about Latinx students. We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students' coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students' coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student's learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging).},

In this paper we describe the experience of children in Bangalore, India, when Torino was introduced to them as a toy for creating and sharing stories, songs and music. We conducted 12 play sessions with 12 children (4 girls and 8 boys) with diverse backgrounds belonging to three different schools for the blind. We briefly present the reasons for play being central to our effort of bringing computational thinking to children who are blind and low vision in India, and share some experiences of the children and some insights that we have gathered so far: Children not only enjoyed every session, they rapidly moved from playing with pre-created examples, to making changes, to demanding that their favorite stories be told. In observing such play, we could infer that they have grasped the basic concepts of computational thinking? flow of control, variables, loops? though not articulated in that vocabulary.},

To understand design factors affecting the social use of these robots, we explored the use of three programmable robots with distinctive design characteristics in a kindergarten classroom. Our findings suggest that programmable robot designs that may work well for use by individual children may cause difficulties when shared by groups of children if not all children in the group are able to easily perceive the input (program), output (robot actions), or program state. Based on these design factors we provide recommendations for the design of programmable robots, their evaluation for social use, and for addressing design limitations with support by adult facilitators.},

abstract = {With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use–&gt;Modify–&gt;Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&amp;SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&amp;SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&amp;SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&amp;SEE’s potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners.},

abstract = {Free-form Game-Design (GD) environments show promise in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, such environments can be challenging to some students due to their highly open-ended nature. Our long-term goal is to alleviate this difficulty via pedagogical agents that can monitor the student interaction with the environment, detect when the student needs help and provide personalized support accordingly. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of one such agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT environment. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make less errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Based on these results, we provide insights on how to improve the delivery of the agent’s interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {This paper describes our process of creating computational thinking (CT) resources for primary school teachers in Ireland. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has proposed a revised primary mathematics curriculum with an emphasis on CT skills and problem solving, and some teachers would like to introduce it already on an informal basis. However, CT is not yet part of teacher training. Our motivating question has been: how can teachers without a computer science background deliver CT at primary level in Ireland? Our process involves third-level computer science academics co-creating resources with in-service and pre-service teachers during workshops. The resources comprise a workbook and lesson plans. Our resources are based on tasks from the International Bebras Challenge, a well-known large-scale international CT contest with a reasonably gender-neutral profile of school-age participants. The workbook consists of ten Bebras tasks, each followed by a page of original activities on the theme of the task. A set of ten lesson plans accompanies the workbook. Each lesson plan has information about how to use the corresponding workbook activities in the classroom, where the activity might fit into the existing curriculum, categorisation of the task in terms of eight CT topics, differentiation, and extension activities. This paper explains our process of workshop planning, workbook creation, and lesson plan co-creation. Preliminary evaluation of our process uses teacher feedback.},

abstract = {The demand for computational thinking (CT) problem solving abilities surge as every aspect of life becomes more dependent on complex digital technologies. Just as in math and language, a strong CT foundation needs to be established in early education in order for students to develop an instinctive CT perspective of the world. The urgent demand for CT instruction in elementary school quickly draws attention to the shortage of elementary school-level teachers qualified and interested in CT. Additionally, with a commitment to equity in the United States education system and knowledge of the high percentage of English language learning (ELL) students in schools, the obligation to create curricula that will provide access to CT knowledge, skills, and practices for elementary-level ELL students is loudly apparent. In response to these two needs, our team has adapted existing Scratch-based CT curriculum to support classroom teachers with minimal CT experience and to be more accessible to English language learners. The purpose of this paper is to share the framework that guided the curriculum adaptations, to describe the specific changes that were made, and to discuss discoveries made during the process. This journey may be helpful to anyone who is tasked with modifying a curriculum to meet the needs of novice content teachers and ELL students.},

abstract = {Coding as a practical skill and computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive ability have become an important topic in education and research. It has been suggested that CT, as an early predictor of academic success, should be introduced and fostered early in education. However, there is no consensus on the underlying cognitive correlates of CT in young elementary school children. Therefore, the present work aimed at (i) assessing CT and investigating its associations to established cognitive abilities, and (ii) evaluating a newly developed CT course for elementary school children.As such, 31 7-10-year-old children took part in 10 lessons of a structured CT course. The course aimed at introducing and fostering CT concepts in both unplugged and plugged-in ways, incorporating life-size board games, Scratch, Scratch for Arduino, and Open Roberta programming environments. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed several cognitive abilities using standardized tests on nonverbal-visuospatial and verbal reasoning abilities, numeracy, as well as short-term memory, and measured CT using an adapted version of the only existing validated test CTt, to accommodate it to the younger sample.We identified significant associations between CT and nonverbal-visuospatial reasoning, as well as different aspects of numeracy (e.g., fact retrieval and problem completion). In line with recent theoretical accounts and empirical investigations for other age groups, these findings specify the underlying cognitive mechanism of CT in elementary school. Moreover, our results indicated that students were able to specifically improve their CT abilities through the course, as assessed by the adapted version of the CTt.},

abstract = {In the information age, computational thinking has become a basic quality necessary for learners. How to effectively improve the teaching effect and cultivate students' computational thinking ability has become the focus of most scholars. With the extensive development of "Internet+", the traditional face-to-face offline teaching mode has been unable to meet the diversified and personalized learning needs of students, and blended learning has become a brand-new teaching mode, and studies have shown that blended learning can effectively improve the computational thinking ability of learners. Therefore, this study analyzes and discusses the current situation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning, which helps us to deeply understand the current situation of high school students' blended learning, think about how to promote high school students' blended learning, and improve high school students' computational thinking ability, so as to promote the quality of education and teaching. In this study, the literature research method, interview analysis method and questionnaire survey method were used to investigate the current situation of blended teaching activities on the cultivation of computational thinking with 138 freshmen, sophomores and juniors in a high school in western China. The results found that the overall situation of computational thinking level in blended learning of students in a high school in western China was moderate. This was characterized by better levels of cooperative and critical thinking skills, and poorer levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills. By describing the current situation, it can be seen that there are some problems in the level of computational thinking ability of high school students in blended learning, based on this, this study, based on the specific research data, combined with the results of the interviews, puts forward some suggestions for improving the cultivation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning in a high school in western China in three aspects.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly becoming a part of the K-12 educational landscape. While high schools with computer science teachers or technology coaches on staff are well positioned to help teachers integrate computational thinking into instruction, early childhood through middle schools (grades p-8) are often less well equipped. Further, the concept of CT is often poorly defined, especially as it relates to younger learners. Despite these challenges, teachers are being asked to integrate CT into other content lessons. To understand if and how this is happening, we conducted a statewide survey of primary (early childhood through middle school) Maryland teachers. The survey asked the teachers about their conceptualization of CT, CT resources they rely on, and their comfort levels to provide effective CT instruction for their students. The results of our survey demonstrate that teachers hold diverse views of the concept of CT and use a varied set of instructional resources in their classrooms. The contribution of this work is in helping advance our understanding of the current state of CT in primary classrooms.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is argued to be an essential skill for the workforce of the 21st century. As a skill, Computational Thinking should be taught in all schools, employing computational ideas integrated into other disciplines. Up until now, questions about how Computational Thinking can be effectively taught have been underexplored preventing efforts to cross the large gap between early adopters and the early majority, conceptualized as the Computer Science Education chasm. A promising strategy to cross the chasm is underway in Switzerland. Switzerland recently introduced a national curriculum, called Lehrplan 21, mandating Computer Science Education. This mandate requires the Computer Science education of elementary and middle school students. In 2017, the School of Education of Northwestern Switzerland (PH FHNW), introduced a mandatory pre-service teacher Computer Science Education course, to satisfy this mandate. All the PH FHNW students who study to become elementary school teachers must pass this two-semester course. The first part of this course was taught for the first time in fall of 2017. This paper presents the philosophy of this course and an initial analysis of both qualitative data capturing the students’ perceptions of Computational Thinking and quantitative data describing shifts in students’ skills and attitudes as effect sizes. The data suggest that it is possible to teach a basic understanding of programming to non-self-selected pre-service elementary school teachers.},

abstract = {For K-8 computer science (CS) education to continue to expand, it is essential that we understand how students develop and demonstrate computational thinking (CT). One approach to gaining this insight is by having students articulate their understanding of CT through cognitive interviews. This study presents findings of a cognitive interview study with 13 fourth-grade students (who had previously engaged in integrated CT and mathematics instruction) working on CT assessment items. The items assessed four CT concepts: sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition. This study analyzed studentstextquotesingle articulated understanding of the four CT concepts and the correspondence between that understanding and hypothesized learning trajectories (LTs). We found that 1) all students articulated an understanding of sequence that matched the intermediate level of the Sequence LT; 2) a majority of studentstextquotesingle responses demonstrated the level of understanding that the repetition and decomposition items were designed to solicit (8 of 9 responses were correct for repetition and 4 of 6 were correct for decomposition); and 3) less than half of studentstextquotesingle responses articulated an understanding of conditionals that was intended by the items (4 of 9 responses were correct). The results also suggested questioning the directional relationships of two statements in the existing Conditionals LT. For example, unlike the LT, this study revealed that students could understand "A conditional connects a condition to an outcome'' before "A condition is something that can be true or false.''},

Our research interests focus on the assessment of fundamental computational thinking competencies, such as collection, organisation and analysis of data, algorithmic thinking and abstraction. For the needs of our research, we implemented the digital platform PhysGramming, which constitutes the backbone of a relevant assessment tool we have built. PhysGramming is developmentally appropriate for first and second grade primary school students and provides the opportunity to create their own digital games, transforming them from passive consumers to active creators of digital technology. The assessment tool has been applied to 450 students in the first and second grade of primary schools on Crete, Greece from February to June 2019. The research was conducted attuned to the ethical guidelines of educational research, within the framework of the physical and natural science courses and evolved around three axes: (a) Checking the validity and the reliability of the results that come out when applying the proposed assessment tool. (b) Designating the levels of computational thinking skills of students at first stages of schooling. (c) Checking the correlation between the levels of computational thinking skills and the comprehension of the lesson's content. In other words, we check whether high learning performance is a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosing high levels of basic computational thinking skills. In this paper, we shortly describe the assessment tool we propose.},

abstract = {This paper presents an educational experience about the feasibility of using the KIBO robot to engage the learning of programming and computational thinking with students with Down syndrome (DS). In particular, we describe a pilot study carried out with seven DS students aged between 7-19, but with a cognitive age from 3--6. The programming and computational thinking contents had been adapted to their particular needs and integrated into their current curricular activities. We studied the engaging of students using KIBO, the grade of comprehension of the sequences and programming and the emotional behavior of students with DS during the sessions. The results of this study shows that people with DS are capable to acquire satisfactorily basic programming and computational thinking skills using KIBO. Also, the motivation and the emotional state of DS students were positive promoted through the designed activities.},

In this poster session, the authors will introduce their research on developing Chinese elementary school students' computational thinking skill. The authors have developed a new information technology course with the focus on computational thinking. The research uses the convergent cognition theory as the theoretical framework. The convergent cognition theory posits that learning computer programming affects students' mathematical thinking and vice versa. The programming environment is Scratch. A group of third grade students and a group of fourth grade students are the participants. Their computational thinking skill and math ability will be measured to see whether this course develops students' computational thinking skill and whether convergent cognition effects exist. Examples from the instructional materials will be presented as part of the poster. The authors will also report on the preliminary results of the course's effectiveness on developing students' computational thinking.},

abstract = {The Swedish government has recently introduced digital competence including programming in the Swedish K-9 curriculum starting no later than fall 2018. This means that 100 000 teachers need to learn programming and digital competence in less than a year. In this paper we report on our experience working with professional teacher training in Sweden's fifth largest city. The city has about 150 000 inhabitants and about 50 schools with about 14 000 students in primary education. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with the municipality.The work started in the fall of 2014 with a pilot study with 10 teachers in different subjects that was carried out during spring 2015. The pilot study was successful as the teachers were able to introduce activities related to programming and computational thinking in their subjects after only two half day workshops. The next step was to scale this up to include all the schools in the city. As expected, this turned out to be a larger challenge. More than 70 teachers were involved in the second part of the project. Some of the lessons learned are that it is quite easy to provide teacher training, but harder to get teachers to actually change their teaching and even more challenging to get teachers to help their colleagues introduce programming or computational thinking in their teaching.Based on our experience we draw some general conclusions and make suggestions for how to scale up the teaching of programming and computational thinking to all.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a set of sequence test called CTST, and to determine whether it can be used to assess Sequencing Ability in computational thinking (CT). The content of the test is adapted from Baron-Cohen's picture story. We selected 5-7-year-old students (N=1234) from seven public schools in China for the test. The difficulty and distinguishing degree of each question were tested. Combined with the result of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), it is concluded that the sequence tests questions was composed of thirteen items, including three factors (amount, event and machine). Among them, four of the items that did not meet the standard were deleted. Our study also explored the differences of gender and age between 5-7-year-old students. The results show that the Sequencing Ability of girls is stronger than that of boys, and 7-year-old children may be the key period for the development of sequential ability. Generally speaking, the sequential test has good psychometric characteristics and can distinguish children with different CT sequencing Ability. We also discussed the limitations and direction of future work.},

The results have led a personalized education for students, recognizing previous skills as well as trying to correct those missing, so that it acquires the competences respective, credit the course and improve the retention percentage of the first quarter. In this sense, when detecting possible skill gaps, is it possible to predict what will be the impact to maintain or decrease enrollment during and the end of quarter? The present work aims to answer the question by the results interpretation obtained from the computational thinking evaluation to 242 new students, generation 2018. Initially, it was stablished which would be the student's situation during and the end of four months from September to December based on the correct assessment reagents; three categories were determined: 1. Sure desertion, 2. Safe permanence, 3. Variable permanence. Later, 50 students who enrolled the next quarter (January-April 2019) were revised if they had been predicted properly; using a survey, the familiarity of key concepts of the subject Programming methodology was obtained with the aim of determining a correspondence with the evaluation of computational thinking skills, as well as the established situation, consequently, establishing the validity of predicting the enrollment.},

This new reality brings with it the need for children and young people to develop new basic skills linked to what has been called computational thinking. Computational thinking taught from an early age may allow individuals and society to understand and use new conceptual structures and models that represent complex phenomena and processes in the world around us. However, stimulating the development of computational thinking at an early age (preschool) continues to be an academic challenge whose approach requires research, interdisciplinary work, and innovation.

abstract = {As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1\% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.},

abstract = {Technology can be both a bane and a boon to education. Social media apps and digital games offer rich and highly stimulating forms of engagement outside of the classroom. This level of stimulus has created challenges for traditional educational paradigms and approaches. A promising response is for educators to embrace technology through interactive apps and gamification.This workshop provides hands-on engagement with a collection of freely-available interactive web apps that focus on the development of visual, spatial, and computational thinking. The workshop concludes with participants playing a third-person Unity game in which the (interactive) standalone web apps presented in the workshop have been embedded. The game, inspired by Han Solo's Kessel run, involves a trek across a sequence of platforms located in a galaxy far far away. Teleportation from one platform to the next is enabled by correctly completing the activity contained in the embedded (and interactive) web apps and then having the player walk through a portal. The player game score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of their engagement with the exercises present.},

To address this issue, an interdisciplinary team derived a set of design rationales (integration of learning activities, scaffolding progression, cross-device interaction and supporting collaboration in all activities) and developed CoTinker: a collaborative, cross-device tool designed to foster equity in the form of equal participation amongst students. Through a pilot study, we investigated high-school students (n=15), working with CT activities supported by CoTinker, in the form of a computer model of a biological phenomenon. We found that CoTinker was able to support students’ remote collaborative work and participation equity. Furthermore, students were able to take advantage of cross-device interaction using their laptop and mobile phones in concert. We conclude that the design rationales and CoTinker design can serve as useful starting points for enabling equitable collaboration amongst students working with CT.},

Still, few such tests have been created and even fewer have undergone rigorous psychometric evaluation and been made available to researchers. The purpose of this study is to report our work in developing and validating a test of computational thinking concepts and skills and to compare different scoring methods for the test. This computational thinking exam is intended to be used in computing education research as a common measure of computational thinking so that the research community will be able to make more meaningful comparisons across samples and studies. The Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test (CTCAST) was administered to students in several courses, evaluated and revised, and then administered to another group of students. Part of the revision included changing half of the items to a multiple-select format. The test scores using the three scoring methods were compared to each other and to scores on a different test of core computer science knowledge. Results indicate the CTCAST and the test of core computer science knowledge measure similar, but not identical, aspects of students' knowledge and skills, and that item-level statistics vary according to the scoring method that is used. Recommendations for using and scoring the test are presented.},

abstract = {The usage of playful activities is common in introductory programming settings. There is normally a virtual character or a physical robot that has to collect items or reach a goal within a map. Visually, these activities tend to be exciting enough to maintain children engaged: there is constant feedback about the actions being performed, and the virtual environments tend to be stimulating and aesthetically pleasant. Conversely, in adaptations for visually impaired children, these environments tend to become poorer, damaging the story at the cost of the programming actions and its dull mechanics (e.g., place a arrow block to move the character forward). In this paper, we present TACTOPI, a playful environment designed from the ground up to be rich in both its story (a nautical game) and its mechanics (e.g., a physical robot-boat controlled with a 3D printed wheel), tailored to promote computational thinking at different levels (4 to 8 years old).

The curriculum utilizes multiple representations, requiring students to work with physical phenomena, chemical equations, digital simulations, and modifiable code-based representations. Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-through-abstraction. This perspective moves computation from an internally focused exercise into the expression of valued ideas in a computational medium.},

This study proposes integrating Technology Readiness Index(TRI) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as main factors to examine how it enhances the CT in Malaysian education. In addition, this integration will operate as the main theoretical framework for this research study and form a model in this research study, namely Technology Readiness Acceptance Model (TRAM). This study shall establish a suitable adoption model to integrate computational thinking from the Malaysian education perspective for the future industrial revolution. The discussion and explanation on the factors that enhance CT in Malaysian education are discussed further in the paper.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has recently gained more and more relevance as problem-solving competence of the 21st century. Taking Wing's [1] grand vision into account, each student should have certain skills in computational thinking in order to be able to participate adequately in social life and in his/her future profession. Thus, the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS 2018) does in addition to other student competences also measure their achievement in computational thinking [2]. In this internationally comparative large-scale assessment with a representative sample, a sound body of information is gathered that is used, among others, to explain variation in students' achievement in computational thinking. One field that represents a national extension in Germany is problem-solving. This paper presents a PhD project that focuses on this field and provides an analysis model that examines the relationship between students' self-perceived problem-solving skills and their computational thinking skills, taking into account further variables of influence and aims to explain variation in students' achievement of computational thinking.},

This argument is the basis for the slogan "logic first, syntax later" and the development of many cryptic syntax removed programming languages such as Scratch!, Blockly and Visual Logic. The goal is to focus on the structuring of the semantic relationships among the logical building blocks to yield solutions to computational problems. In this paper, we introduce a new programming platform, called the CodeMapper, in which learners are able to build computational logic in independent modules and aggregate them to create complex modules. CodeMapper is an abstract development environment in which rapid visual prototyping of systems is possible by combining already developed independent modules in logical steps.},

abstract = {In this study, we adapted the notion of framing, a theoretical construct that refers to a person's expectations about social spaces (Goffman, 1974), to investigate whether teachers viewed computational thinking (CT) according to subject-specific frames. This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.},

abstract = {The acquisition of Computational Thinking (CT) skills is an essential goal of Computer Science (CS) education. Assessment of CT is critical for CS teaching and research. However, there is a paucity of developmentally appropriate CT measures designed for early elementary school children. Among existing measures, there has been little attention paid to methods for comparing CT skills across grades. In the present study, I examined the use of a normalized scoring system for comparing performance on three grade-specific versions of the TechCheck CT assessment. TechCheck is a brief, unplugged, multiple-choice instrument for children 5-9 years of age that probes six domains of CT. Baseline raw score TechCheck data from 596 students showed normal distributions with significant differences in means between grades. I calculated Z-scores and percentile ranks by grade. This normalization allowed for the comparison of CT skills within and across grades in the context of a pilot longitudinal study of the CAL-ScratchJr coding curriculum. Application of the normative scoring system showed a difference in the outcome of only 4 percentile ranks between first and second graders while raw scores indicated an improbable 45\% difference. This study demonstrates that normalized TechCheck scores that take into account differences in the score distributions across grades can improve the measurement of CT skills in the context of early childhood CS educational interventions.},

This paper presents a case study of middle schoolers in an informal learning environment focused on integrating music composition with coding in TunePad. Specifically, we collected and analyzed logs of coding events, final code products, and surveys to explore both CT concept use and CT practices exhibited by the participants as they completed open-ended music coding activities to create their own melodies with specific music and CT requirements and recommendations.},

abstract = {The computational thinking evaluation in last five years (2016-2020) has allowed to stablish a diagnosis for new students of Information Technologies division at the Universidad Tecnol\'{o}gica de Puebla – Mexico. The immediate benefit has been the offer of learning scenarios for the programming methodology course that impacts the retention indicator. Women and men have benefited from this strategy, but no review of the results had been conducted to determine whether there is any difference in evaluation performance from a gender perspective. As in other countries, in Mexico there is an accentuated percentage difference in terms of men´s election for higher education studies in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This article sets out the data analysis when evaluating five skills associated with the concept of computational thinking, this means, decomposition, abstraction, generalization, algorithmic design and evaluation. The conclusion of the analysis states that there is no significant gender difference in the results of evaluation. Women and men who enter to study the first semester have similar conditions and opportunities for learning the contents and consequently acquire the respective competencies.},

Educational robotics and physical computing devices have proved to be an efficient way to teach these skills regardless the students’ age group or previous background. To assess the students’ intrinsic motivation towards Teddy Bear programming, we devised a survey for workshop participants and conducted a statistical analysis to compare differences between the genders and age groups. The results of the large-scale empirical study (n=1440) show that the students at the age of 9-10 years (Grades 3-4) are significantly more motivated towards such a learning tool than the students of age 11-12 years (Grades 5-6). Furthermore, we show that especially young girls find the Teddy Bear programming motivating and they are eager to learn more. This indicates that appealing tools play a key role when teaching programming and CT concepts to young school children.},

The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.},

abstract = {There is a growing need to present all students with an opportunity to learn computer science and computational thinking (CT) skills during their primary and secondary education. Traditionally, these opportunities are available outside of the core curriculum as stand-alone courses often taken by those with preparatory privilege. Researchers have identified the need to integrate CT into core classes to provide equitable access to these critical skills. We have worked in a research-practice partnership with two magnet middle schools focused on digital sciences to develop and implement computational thinking into life sciences classes. In this report, we present initial lessons learned while conducting our design-based implementation research on integrating computational thinking into middle school science classes. These case studies suggest that several factors including teacher engagement, teacher attitudes, student prior experience with CS/CT, and curriculum design can all impact student engagement in integrated science-CT lessons.},

abstract = {Tools like MIT App Inventor and Scratch are designed to help students develop programming and computational thinking skills by allowing them to use their interest and personal experiences to create meaningful artifacts. However, students often need additional help in translating their ideas into functional programs because they lack understanding of how to map the visual aspects of their projects to programming constructs and understanding of how to develop appropriate algorithms that bring their ideas to life. To address this issue, we created a Computational Thinking App Design Mat (App Design Mat) to scaffolds students' CT skill development in the context of creating a mobile application with MIT APP Inventor 2. The App Design Mat fosters student engagement in computational thinking through four areas of the mat: Problem Decomposition, Pattern Abstraction, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithm Design. In this poster will describe the design and results from the use of the App Design Mat with 80 eighth grade students. Our results suggest that most students understood the purpose of using the App Design Mat, used the App Design Mat effectively, and used some aspects of the App Design Mat in developing their final mobile app project.},

Algorithmic thinking (AT) and generalization are two key elements of CT that are often underrepresented in traditional mathematics lessons. This study investigated how to address AT and generalization aspects in 12th-grade calculus lessons using the dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra. We present a six-lesson intervention designed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and teachers with a background in computer science and mathematics education that aims to foster pre-university students’ AT and generalization skills in calculus lessons. We evaluated the intervention in a 15 students classroom in the Netherlands through the analysis of students’ workbooks, files, interviews, and the teacher’s logbook. The findings suggest that the intervention was favorably seen by both the teacher and the students, and that their learning and teaching experience was highly satisfactory. The most common challenges for successfully completing the designed material included issues related to getting familiar with GeoGebra, syntax, and effectively using conditional statements. Finally, we report on the learning and teaching experience and discuss strategies to address AT and generalization aspects for teachers who wish to address such CT aspects in mathematics lessons.},

Eye-tracking has become one of the most popular methods to study what individuals view, in what order, for how long, and how often, and it is a technology that could give us a window into students' cognitive processes and could be used as an assessment tool for comprehension of CTCs [1].This study presents eye-tracking technology as an objective, non-intrusive, and easy-to-administer assessment instrument to measure students' comprehension of core CTCs including sequences, loops, events, parallelism, conditionals, operators, data, motion, looks, sound, pen, and sensing. It explores gradual changes in students' comprehension of CTCs as reflected on three eye-gaze data as a proxy; FD (Fixation Duration), SA (Saccade Amplitudes), and RF (Regression Frequency).},

abstract = {Developing computational thinking (CT) assessment methods appropriate for elementary students is attracting growing attention as CT research in elementary education progresses. To review the current elementary CT assessments for potential gaps, and seek additional methodologies to expand our understanding of CT, an integrative literature review of 75 research papers was performed in two phases. In Phase One, we conducted a critical analysis of existing elementary CT assessment studies. Key results include: 1) Artifact analysis, CT assessment items, and interviews are the most common methods utilized to assess CT in elementary grades; 2) Existing CT assessments primarily focus on students' computational artifacts and performance on CT tests; however, strategies to study students' thought processes during CT problem-solving are limited and under-utilized. Guided by the results of phase one, along with the theoretical perspective that connected CT to visual processing ability, in phase two we performed a survey of literature in the area of understanding cognitive processes through eye-tracking (i.e., visual attention) and think-aloud methodologies (i.e., verbalization). We focused on eye-tracking and think-aloud methodologies as these have been used to understand students' cognitive processes during problem-solving in other areas. Based on these findings, we proposed that in addition to current established methodologies, eye-tracking with the think-aloud technique can provide new insights into students' CT.},

This is now an annual event, where all participating children can slip into the role of researchers and present the results of their projects accomplished together with their teachers as well as teacher students of different master courses. As preparation the project teams get an introduction into computational thinking and several computer science concepts with the task of applying at least one of them in their project and the development of creative products. The themes of the Children's Congress are relatively open and fit into every subject, because our main aim is introducing computational thinking "by the way" to all participants. During their work on cross-curricular or even subject specific projects, pupils, students and teachers learn that basics of computational thinking are or can be integrated in every subject. This paper reports on the implementation and procedure of the Children's Congress and gives an overview of the projects accomplished in the first two years (2016 and 2017). It describes how and where computational thinking has been integrated and presents the main results of the evaluation gained from interviews and questionnaires.},

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is regarded as a key competency for k-12 children in the 21st century. In this project, a design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students’ CT. This approach included programming skills learning and STEM practices with authentic real-life contexts. We assessed CT in a more accurate manner with experience-sampling methodology (ESM). A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students’ self-perceived CT skills using event-based experience-sampling methodology. Forty sixth graders engaged in the curriculum units to create artifacts that solve specific real-world problems using Arduino electronic kits and Mind+ programming software. Results revealed that students’ self-perceived CT skills increased to a greater extent statistically. Using the experience sampling method, students’ self-perceived CT skills has different fluctuations in different stages of DBL, at the third phase of designing artifact, there is a significant decrease because learners are unfamiliar at the beginning of complicated cooperation in depth, which is likely to produce discourse conflicts and reduce efficiency. With the intervention of teachers, learners begin to improve greatly in the later stage. Learners have the highest CT in the iteration and improvement phases of prototype making and the final demonstration stage. In addition, collaboration plays an extremely important role in DBL, especially in the design phase. This study contributes to research in DBL teaching approach, CT instruction, its application in STEM education in particular, and how it can be used in elementary level education in general.},

Several off-the-shelf technologies exist to promote computational abilities with the support of block-based programming and working hardware. However, in some contexts, a significant limitation is the complexity and costs that carry the acquisition and implementation of working hardware such as Educational Robots. In this paper, we discuss a strategy to reinforce the learning of Computational Thinking (CT) skills by providing an analogous method to Educational Robots. We offer an affordable solution to assist high school students to build a CT-based software/hardware integrated solution. We executed this strategy in a coding bootcamp where students were required to design and implement an algorithm, and illustrate its execution in software and hardware. The proposed exercise delivered the expected results engaging students to ideate the solution of a problem, implement an algorithm, and create a physical demonstration of it.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is being considered as a key set of problem-solving skills to be acquired by the new generations of digital citizens and workers in order to thrive in a computer-based world. However, from a psychometric point of view, CT is still a poorly defined psychological construct: there is no full consensus on a formal definition of CT or how to measure it; and its correlations with other psychological constructs, whether cognitive or non-cognitive, have not been completely established. In response to the latter, this paper aims to study specifically the correlations between CT and the several dimensions from the 'Big Five' model of human personality: Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) are administered on a sample (n = 99) of Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade. Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These results are partially consistent with the literature about the links between cognitive and personality variables, and corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT. Hence, educational interventions aimed at fostering CT should take into account these non-cognitive issues in order to be comprehensive and successful.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been significant interest in integrating Maker-related experiences into formal education. A challenge is reconciling open-ended making and non-deterministic learning goals with standards that drive traditional education. In the context of our CS-focused STEM magnet school, we designed two 2nd grade lessons that not only align with grade-level standards and our school's computer science-oriented pedagogy, but also incorporate 3D printing and the philosophy of Makerspaces. The integrated Maker experience serves to scaffold computational thinking practices such as abstraction, modeling, and decomposition, which are essential for long-term success in STEM learning. To bring these aspects together, we created a rubric based on existing evaluation tools. Using this rubric, we evaluated the two lessons with a small sample of participants. Our pilot study shows promise of mastery in standard-related content, evidence of a making mindset, engagement in the activity, innovation in design, and solidarity in working with peers. Aligning state standards with open-ended Maker activities has potential for fostering student growth and engagement in the classroom. An additional component of our research was reflecting on our experience as teachers with no Makerspace experience who were newly submerged in the digital fabrication world. We present the two 3D printing-based lessons, one addressing extreme weather standards, the other incorporating understanding of urban, suburban, and rural communities. We also present the rubric we designed, the literature that guided this work, and reflections and recommendations from our experience of learning digital fabrication for the first time and integrating it into curriculum.},

abstract = {Game design is increasingly used in modern education to foster Computational Thinking (CT). Yet, it is unclear how and if the game genre of student-designed games impact CT and programming. We explore how game genre impacts CT development and programming routines in Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students using a metrics-based approach (i.e., Dr. Scratch). Our findings show that designing particular games (e.g., action, storytelling) impact CT and programming development. We observe, for instance, that CT skills develop and consolidate fast, after which students can focus on aspects more specific to game design. Based on the results, we suggest that researchers and educators in constructionist learning consider the impact of game genre when designing game-based curricula for the learning of programming and CT.},

Building on prior methods used with the digital science learning games, Impulse and Quantum Spectre, we are combining video analysis and educational data mining to identify implicit computational thinking that emerges through gameplay [1]. This paper reports on the first phase of this process: developing a human labeling system for evidence of specific CT skills (e.g., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, abstraction) in three Zoombinis puzzle by analyzing video data from a sample of elementary learners, middle school learners, game experts, and computer scientists. Future work will combine these human-labeled video data with game log data from these 70+ learners and computer scientists to create automated assessments of implicit computational thinking skills from gameplay behaviors in large player audiences.

In this study, social stories are used to teach autistic children social skills. Combining sequential computational thinking as a learning strategy and applying Conductive Copper Foil Tape and Makey Makey, a social story teaching aid is made. With the help of it, children can learn the content from social stories, learn social stories through computational thinking and arrange corresponding sequence structure. Three autistic children from Grade 1 took part in six teaching experiments and were observed their change of social skills. The results showed that scientific teaching aid could improve autistic children's social ability, speaking skills, attention, and learning interests, making them observe the storytelling more carefully and easily, understand the story development, and learn social skills from it. Besides, this teaching aid could improve autistic children's social reciprocity and provide theoretical references for relevant fields.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a popular phrase that refers to a collection of computational ideas and habits of mind that people in computing disciplines acquire through their work in designing programs, software, simulations, and computations performed by machinery. Recently a computational thinking for K-12 movement has spawned initiatives across the education sector, and educational reforms are under way in many countries. However, modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed: evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition, dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.},

This technique of teaching uses mistakes as a learning tool to teach computational thinking. Instead of simply showing and explaining correct solutions, code with logical errors is presented to the class. After verifying the code does not work, the class as a whole, becomes engaged in trying to correct the logical errors in code presented to the class. In this paper, we reference the Student Query Directed Learning approach which we map into our techniques. We present a transcript of a lecture one of the authors has given using this technique to illustrate motivations, how to steer the conversation where we want it to go, and student/instructor interactions. Finally, we suggest some "ground rules" to ensure this environment is all-encompassing and one which is conducive to learning.},

Here, we present a five-session curriculum where sixth-grade students programmed a Liquid Handling Robot (LHR) to conduct a science experiment while engaging in CT. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess how the curricular integration of robotics and science experimentation advances students’ CT skills and perceptions of computation in science. We identified growth in CT skills, specifically regarding Algorithmic Thinking. Students identified as key advantages of this approach the increased precision in experimental procedures, time-efficiency, and easier debugging. This course provides a proof of concept curriculum on how the implications for teaching and learning of CT can be assessed, and how CT and robotics can be brought to science classrooms, especially for chemistry and biology.},

Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as a tool for developing XXI century skills, but Chile has a large population of in-service teachers that do not know what CT is, limiting its application in classrooms. In response, the government has enacted a training program for in-service primary school teachers, focusing on changing their perceptions about CT, and showing them how it can be used in classroom. This training program was designed for grades 1-6 and piloted in the capital region during 2018. The program initially focused on coding activities, but was then redesigned to show how CT can be used to help meet the learning objectives of different subjects in the curriculum. The program was then scaled up nationwide. In this experience report, we discuss the outcomes of this program. The training program scaled as intended and we identified positive changes in teacher perceptions about CT, especially among female participants. We conclude with the lessons we learned from this experience.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking can be defined as a set of skills for problem solving based on Computer Science. Computational Thinking skills are not only limited to the field of computing but also extensible to all areas of knowledge. Young people grow up surrounded by technology but many of them go for university without any prior knowledge in computer science. Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking abilities in students all over the world. Teaching computational thinking must necessarily involve problem-solving, and can be applied to various types of problems that do not directly involve coding tasks. However, it is recognized to everyone that programming is a good way to improve Computational Thinking. In this article, we have done a survey on the existing tools that use the codification as main means of development of the abilities of computational thinking or not. It was also a concern to mention those that provide a wide variety of resources for teachers. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate the importance of computational thinking in the first beginning of learning programming, and what activities best contribute to increase the abilities of each computer engineering student in computational thinking according to the characteristics of those who attend the Polytechnic of Guarda, Portugal. Most of our students have never had the opportunity to learn computational thinking.},

We report an intervention over 9 months to introduce eleven young homeschoolers to CT in a suburban environment, describing the impact on parent and children attitudes towards technology and CT.

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a set of concepts and problem-solving skills that are not only imperative for computer scientists, but important and applicable to nearly every discipline. CT skills are essential in a world where technology is ubiquitous. In the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop and evaluate computational thinking in primary and secondary students. Promoting CT skills in these young students can help reduce the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM careers since students who are exposed to CT at an early age are more likely to pursue a STEM discipline in college [18].This paper describes the COSMIC program, funded by Google's Tides Foundation, that introduces middle school students to CS and CT using the CS First curriculum and Scratch. The COSMIC activities spanned three years directly serving 700 students through 175 distinct events. Females comprised 51.1\% of the individuals served, and 10.2\% of those served were part of a minority group. The COSMIC activities allowed the researchers to investigate the effectiveness of the CS First curriculum. Using the Hairball-powered Dr. Scratch analysis tool on the curricular projects, the paper reports on the efficacy of the CS First curriculum in terms of its coverage of vital CT concepts and its success in transferring those concepts to middle school students.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is emerging as an important theme in computer science and high school education. However, research is needed to inform high-school teachers how to foster students' development of CT in computer science and other subjects. Evidence suggests that agent-based modeling is a valuable way for students to learn CT in different subjects. This paper reports a teaching experiment where researchers, developers, and high school teachers collaborated to develop six NetLogo models. The models were used in nine Danish High Schools in the following four subjects: Biotechnology, chemistry, biology, and social science. Teachers and students had no or very limited experience with programming. Students build CT and content knowledge by using, modifying, and creating code in the models. This paper provides details for others to adopt the models and the underlying CMC framework, which integrates: Coding, Modeling, and Content. The paper evaluates the results from an open-ended questionnaire with all participating students (n=210) and semi-structured interviews with all teachers (n=15). Thematic analysis was applied to categorize the qualitative data. Results showed that students were able to use, modify, and create code in NetLogo that enabled them to develop CT and content knowledge. The CMC framework represents a fruitful way for teachers to design and teach and for students to tinker with learning CT.},

abstract = {Several countries have usually adopted several priorities for developing ICT competences from kindergarten to secondary education. Most of them are focused on the development of key competences and/or coding skills. Although coding may be very attractive for young students and a very good practice or experience, it could be more interesting to develop students' logical thinking skills and problem-solving skills throughout programming approaches or computational thinking. This is a very exciting challenge with lots of possibilities regarding coding, robots, mobiles devices, Arduino-based application, game-based learning and so on. Thus it is very important discuss the experiences that are being developed worldwide in specialized for a with researchers that are working on this field, such as for example European Union TACCLE 3 - Coding project. This track is devoted to identify, share and valorize best practices and experiences (including technological and methodological issues) that focused on the development of computational thinking and related skills in any level of pre-university education.},

In this study, we examine implicit computational thinking (CT) skills of 72 upper elementary and middle school students and 10 computer scientists playing a game called Pizza Pass. We report on the process of creating automated detectors to identify four CT skills from gameplay: problem decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, and abstraction. This paper reports on hand-labeled playback data obtaining acceptable inter-rater reliability and 100 gameplay features distilled from digital log data. In future work, we will mine these features to automatically identify the CT skills previously labeled by humans. These automated detectors of CT will be used to analyze gameplay data at scale and provide actionable feedback to teachers in real-time.},

abstract = {Technologies of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have contributed significantly to the emergence of the Knowledge Society. However, there is a strong gender gap in the field of science and technology due to the influence of the male-centered culture that persists today. Computational thinking is presented as a way to develop in children from an early age the ability to solve problems, designing systems and understanding human behavior while using the fundamental concepts of computing. This factor allows girls to be in touch with technology in a fun and meaningful way; so as to balance the male and female presence in science and technology, achieving a more egalitarian system. In this article is presented a systematic review of the literature which indicates that few studies about computational thinking are working from a gender perspective, although some countries have already opted for teaching computer in the classroom. In addition, the review shows some methodologies which are using languages and suitable tools in order to work the computational thinking. Notwithstanding, It can be the basis for a proposal to integrate the gender perspective. In turn, it is committed to the creation of a methodological guide that encourages this teaching in national and international schools.},

abstract = {The contiguity of physical and digital content of embodied learning has been shown to increase student's engagement in educational contexts. Applications with various kinds of physical interactions have been deployed to enhance the learning experiences in many engineering domains. However, even though computer science education (CSE) is one of zestful topics in the recent years, there are few studies focusing on the embodiment of CSE materials, by which the abstract and intangible concepts could be transformed into an intuitive affordance that utilizes sensorimotor experiences during the learning process. We propose an augmented embodiment mobile app designed for computational thinking (CT), specifically the debugging practices and abstraction concept, that makes use of gestures and augmented reality for learners to interact with the content. We examine the logic by the design framework for embodied learning and discuss potential extensions of multimodal analytics in such an application. Our preliminary user study in a middle school shows students' engagement in the application, however, it also reflected several design issues that need to be solved in the next iteration. The future plan of data analysis and experiments is also discussed.},

One can learn computational concepts by taking a traditional course offered in a school or by self-guided learning through an online platform. Whatever the form of learning, computational concepts can be difficult to fully comprehend for novices. Collaborative learning has been considered effective in reducing learner's anxiety and in helping struggling learners overcome common learning difficulties. The proposed dissertation study aims to investigate how collaboration impacts learning of CT across both classroom setting and in an online learning community.

abstract = {Many programs offer informal experiences in programming for select students who may qualify or whose parents pay fees for attending. Integrating computational thinking (CT) in the formal classroom setting provides equal opportunities to develop valuable problem-solving skills for all students. However, such integration poses challenges since teachers may have limited experiences in computing and may be pressured by time constraints due to the need to cover Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as well as district specific initiatives. A 2-year intervention has been designed to target upper elementary level self-contained classrooms to increase teachers' knowledge and ability for integrating CT into science lessons. Twenty teachers from four school districts in Southern California participated in the first year of the project's professional development activities. These schools have varying levels of diversity and socioeconomic status of student populations. Instead of using popular drag-and-drop programming tools such as Scratch or Tynker, the first year of the project focused on key CT concepts and helped teachers connect these concepts with skills important for student success in science activities. This paper reports on the study of the project's impact on student learning of key CT concepts among students from project classrooms. The main elements of the professional development are also described.},

We show the primary education students' perceptions of the use of the software Lego Education WeDo in the subject of natural sciences to promote the computational thinking. We tried to test the following hypotheses: Students will learn to build and program 3D models with Lego Education WeDo (H1), students will think creatively to solve the problems (H2), Lego Education WeDo will help pupils to know the relationship between cause and effect (H3), and the tasks developed will allow pupils to reflect about the possibilities they have and to find the correct answer (H4). Based on the result analysis there were evidences of the effectiveness of the project to increase the participants' awareness of the computational thinking. The research also concluded that according to learners' perception, the way in which activities were designed provided them possibilities to learn to build models in 3D and program them. Moreover, the findings of the study also demonstrated that the success of the project also depended on the teacher's role as a guide in the teaching-learning process.},

We often found it difficult to explain the boundaries and clear definitions for CT in research, to students and their teachers. Literature provides a variety of definitions from various perspectives, but these definitions often seem like capturing smoke. We see evidence CT, indicating fire, but how hot or lasting it burns cannot be measured by smoke alone. CT is typically defined by siloed concepts and skills. Some silos describe concrete ideas, which tend to be tied to programming principles. Many describe essential ideas, but over generalized becoming hard to teach and measure and distinguish from other types of problem solving. Is there a middle ground where we can clearly observe the presence and growing maturing of CT yet not limit the ways it can manifest, particularly without requiring coding? We hope this poster inspires conversation on 1.) the intersection of CT and programming skills, 2.) the priority and order for learning those skills, and 3.) how we can promote CT in disciplines who interact with and help define computational solutions yet are never expected to learn to program. We hope to share our perspective as well as garner feedback and possibly collaboration on better refining curriculum within Computer Science as well as promoting CT in other disciplines.},

However, there is still a lack of tools that assist learners and educators in the assessment of these skills. We have implemented an assessment tool, called Dr. Scratch, that analyzes Scratch projects with the aim to assess the level of development of several aspects of computational thinking. One of the issues to address in order to show its validity is to compare the (automatic) evaluations provided by the tool with the (manual) evaluations by (human) experts. In this paper we compare the assessments provided by Dr. Scratch with over 450 evaluations of Scratch projects given by 16 experts in computer science education. Our results show strong correlations between automatic and manual evaluations. As there is an ample debate among educators on the use of this type of tools, we discuss the implications and limitations, and provide recommendations for further research.},

In addition, research shows that the integration of CT in education has the potential to improve the problem-solving skills of K-12 students. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a CT experimental course on 94 primary school students' perceptions of their problem-solving skills as well as possible correlations between the variables concerning the students' perceptions. Participants worked in pairs in the context of Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, and the data were collected through the Problem-Solving Inventory for Children (PSIC). A one-group pretest-posttest was conducted and the results suggest that a CT course can improve participants' overall perceptions of their problem-solving skills. Finally, increases in the participants' levels of control over emotions and behavior when facing problems were correlated with increases in their will to face their problems rather than avoid them.},

The main objective is to increase the confidence of students in the solution of problems through the skills that exercise Computational Thinking. This report details the planning of the activities, the indicators to be measured and the scenarios where the interventions will be carried out that allow, in a second stage, the creation of strategies to avoid desertion. The main conclusion of the paper is to have created an academic strategy to benefit the understanding of pre-university students in the current computer world through the exercise of Computational Thinking.},

So far, however, no relevant research has described whether teachers or future teachers are familiar with these resources, whether they can use them, and whether they also meet their needs. We want to respond to all these facts in our research.},

abstract = {Using, processing and evaluating digitized information is relevant to every subject in primary and secondary school education. As this information is represented, modified and perceived through analog and digital media, competencies including critical reflection, knowledge, usage, and creation of information and media have been included in the German education system. Due to the highly inter- and transdisciplinary character of these skills, the development of a combined information and media literacy to teach the critical handling, reflection and design of information and (digital) media similar to a classical literacy concerning reading and writing skills. As this skill is fundamental for understanding the everyday digital environment, Computational Thinking poses a central idea of information and media literacy in order to understand how information of the real or fictional world are represented through digital media, how this digitized information is automaticly processed and displayed using media systems as well as how the resulting representations are interpreted. Information and media literacy adresses every subject and school type which is why it has to be integrated into future teacher education curricula. This paper shows the conception and implementation of an Information and Media Literacy certificate for student teachers with a focus on Computational Thinking. Based on recent studies, established curricula for Media Literacy, Computer Literacy and Digital Literacy as well as present Bavarian school curricula for Computer Science, we built the curriculum for the Computational Thinking part of the certificate upon fundamental ideas of Computer Science: Representation of Information, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Networks, Data Integrity and Data Security, Languages, and Physical Computing.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has been recognized as one of the fundamental skills that all graduates should acquire. For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers’ feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.},

abstract = {Work in culturally responsive pedagogy and culturally responsive computing (CRC)(Scott, et al., 2014) holds promise for how to include underrepresented students into making communities as they develop their computational thinking (CT) skills. Cultural responsiveness involves instructors using what they know about students' individual identities to develop learning opportunities; having high expectations; and understanding students' sociopolitical contexts (Ladson-Billings, 1995). By integrating these approaches, students encounter a makerspace without pre-determined cultural norms that encourages questioning assumptions that limit the development of inclusive technology. This poster explores preliminary results from a mixed methods multiple case study. Sixteen high school students participated in a two-week summer making program that focused on CT and physics skills. Students shared elements of their identities, brought in artifacts for "show and tell", collected data on how they spend their time, and categorized assets in their communities to then incorporate into their own projects. Researchers analyzed classroom observations, videos, interviews, and student notebooks, as well as students' pre-post tests and attitudinal surveys. Findings reflect the importance of valuing student identity, building community, and highlighting how CT and physics affect students' lives.

For these reasons, the experimental research method is the one-group pretest-posttest design that we adopted which was conducted with 26 students, identified as learning disabilities by the committee for Identification and Placement of Gifted and Disabled Student. Data collected are analyzed with the Paired Sample t-test to comparison of these students in their learning outcomes and difference in aspects of construction of mathematical concepts and development of computational thinking after teaching. We find this teaching method enhances the learning outcomes and performance in the Math unit of Perimeter and Area and the performance of the development of computational thinking of these students after the intervention (160 minutes).},

abstract = {We are developing ways to teach computational thinking through interaction with tangible digital tools for synthetic biology. Inspired in part by Jeannette Wing's (Wing 2008) notion of the essence and pervasiveness of computational thinking, a growing community within SIGCSE is exploring tools that encourage computational thinking that don't use traditional computer science terminology or computer programming (Basawapna 2013, Daily 2014, Freeman 2014, Miller 2014, Wolz 2011). However, that community has not yet explored how to teach computational thinking through bio-design. Synthetic biology is a relatively new research field where scientists engineer living organisms to exhibit new behaviors. Biologists arrange and combine BioBricks, sequences of DNA that exhibit a behavior, sense an environmental factor, or indicate the beginning or end of a larger sequence. Bio-design not only incorporates traditional principles of computational thinking (abstraction, modularity, design/build/test), but also introduces new challenges that force the user to apply these principles in new ways. Interacting with biology can thus 1) help deepen understanding for people who are proficient in computational thinking, 2) provide a platform for introduction to computational thinking for the first time. Because most bio-design is performed in a wetlab by experienced biologists, we focus now on designing and developing low-barrier digital tools for interacting with biology. We present SynFlo (Okerlund 2016), a tangible interactive system for bio-design that mimics a real-life biological wetlab protocol and we discuss the properties of SynFlo and bio-design in general that encourage computational thinking.},

First, we show that users who remix more often have larger repertoires of programming commands even after controlling for the numbers of projects and amount of code shared. Second, we show that exposure to computational thinking concepts through remixing is associated with increased likelihood of using those concepts. Our results support theories that young people learn through remixing, and have important implications for designers of social computing systems.},

The project has adapted Code.org learning material and has introduced it to Italian schools with the support of a dedicated web site. Response has been enthusiastic in terms of participation: in two years more than one million students have been engaged and have completed a total of 10 million hours of informatics in schools. Almost all students found the material useful and were interested, teachers have reported. They have also declared to have experienced high satisfaction and a low level of difficulty. A detailed analysis of quantitative and qualitative data about the project is presented and areas for improvement are identified. One of the most interesting observations appears to corroborate the hypothesis that an exposure to informatics since the early age is important to attract students independently from their gender.},

The goal is to teach them basic parallel programming methods, parallel thinking and parallel problem solving methodology by coding on a real supercomputer; let the students learn some representative parallel application development issues and some big challenges in HPC by project practice. In this article, we will present our course design objective, principles, practical method and outcome. Particularly, programming practice methodology, project organization, incentive mechanism and assessment methods in project practice will be illustrated. Finally, we present some quantitative findings.

abstract = {Many advanced countries are recognizing more and more the importance of teaching computing, in some cases even as early as in primary school. "Computational thinking" is the term often used to denote the conceptual core of computer science or "the way a computer scientist thinks", as Wing put it. Such term - given also the lack of a widely accepted definition - has become a "buzzword" meaning different things to different people. We investigated the Italian primary school teachers' conceptions about computational thinking by analyzing the results of a survey (N=972) conducted in the context of "Programma il Futuro" project. Teachers have been asked to provide a definition of computational thinking and to answer three additional related closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that, while almost half of teachers (43.4\%) have included in their definitions some fundamental elements of computational thinking, very few (10.8\%) have been able to provide an acceptably complete definition. On a more positive note, the majority is aware that computational thinking is not characterized by coding or by the use of information technology.},

This paper focuses on how concurrency is dealt with by five well-known tools in this domain: Scratch, Alice, AgentSheets, NetLogo and Greenfoot. We present the results of a systematic analysis contrasting their model of concurrent behavior with the corresponding programming interface messages that trigger their users' interpretation and learning of concurrency-related concepts. We present and discuss the conceptualizations that potentially emerge from using these five tools and compare them with established concurrency concepts. Our findings indicate opportunities for an explicit exploration of how some concurrency aspects are implemented in games and simulations built with CT tools. We believe that this might facilitate future learning and comprehension of complex concurrency concepts, considering that the knowledge embedded in these tools can also influence students' understanding of concurrency.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is nowadays being widely adopted and investigated. Educators and researchers are using two main approaches to teach these skills in schools: with computer programming exercises, and with unplugged activities that do not require the use of digital devices or any kind of specific hardware. While the former is the mainstream approach, the latter is especially important for schools that do not have proper technology resources, Internet connections or even electrical power. However, there is a lack of investigations that prove the effectiveness of the unplugged activities in the development of computational thinking skills, particularly for primary schools. This paper, which summarizes a quasi-experiment carried out in two primary schools in Spain, tries to shed some light on this regard. The results show that students in the experimental groups, who took part in the unplugged activities, enhanced their computational thinking skills significantly more than their peers in the control groups who did not participate during the classes, proving that the unplugged approach may be effective for the development of this ability.},

This work is based on the assertion that making, or the personal construction of objects employing digital and/or analog technologies, can provide a rich context for enacting CT practices. This paper investigates the activities of a group of beginning youth makers creating an interactive digital/ physical water piano to ask: What forms of CT practices do they enact, and in what ways are these practices further developed in their work? Data includes qualitative ethnographic data including observations, recordings and interviews. We explore the ways youth encounter new, yet relatable and intriguing practices---like debugging to isolate an issue---and appropriate them within particular contexts and for particular goals, often to deal with the immediate challenges they are facing. We end by offering conjectures for ways to support beginning youth makers in appropriating CT practices.},

However, the adoption of this kind of game in educational contexts is hindered by the lack of trustworthy design and evaluation methods to access the quality of the games and guide developers and educators. This paper reports the evaluation of a children's digital game for teaching computational thinking, and presents results that contribute to the generation of guidelines related to interface elements, interaction issues and key design choices for performing functions that are common to games of the kind.},

abstract = {The ability to select or customize characters in educational applications and games has been shown to influence factors related to learning effects such as transfer, self-efficacy, and motivation. Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning.We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character. We confirm this hypothesis for a category of learning (Remember and Understand) and give insights on students' relationships with their character.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) ability has been described as a new training objective of basic computer courses in Chinese university. Currently, contents and methods of basic computer course teaching in college have been unable to meet the actual needs to develop CT ability. This paper firstly makes an analysis of possible reasons for the above challenge and then aimed to how to teach and what to teach in a practical way. Our research discussed the basic concept and research status of "computing culture" discussed and extracted above 60 typical cases based "computing culture". These cases focused on discovery joinery of prophetic computer scientists etc. As the main line of teaching, these cases run through in-class teaching and organize every teaching step, such as leading-in, explanation, discussion, dialogue, and conclusion and so on. The several years teaching practice prove the strategies for teaching design put forward in this study is effective to foster a student's sense of "computing" and to arouse the students' interest. The finding concludes that developing the broader value of computing-culture and continued investing in the refine of computing-culture based cases are valuable.},

abstract = {The way in which the student processes the information, codifies it and recovers it, constitutes its learning approach. The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882). This result shows that the learning approaches that students' practice are linked to the computational thinking they demonstrate. According to the results, the teachers of this career must develop active and deep methodological strategies due to the predisposition in these students.},

The proposal is based on correspondence with three of five change trends that integrated the educational model. Regarding the Knowledge society, promote recognition of the individuality of the student as a person who will do university studies, that is, the scenarios respond to the fact that each person learns differently. In the Training of competences, contribute with preventive actions that the teacher communicates when there is a lack of specific skills. Finally, in the Flexibility and articulation, provide a diagnostic tool that favors the recognition of previous competences to have an articulated beginning of studies based on the needs of the student. Consequently, contribute to the INACAP's educational model.},

abstract = {To promote computational thinking (CT) education in primary schools, in-service teachers need to attend CT teacher development programmes. One of the intended learning outcomes of the programme is to improve CT practices of teachers, which is one of the three key elements in the CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick. Assessing one's CT practices is challenging because there is no universally agreed-upon assessment method on CT practices in the existing literature. This study adopted the Evidence-centered Assessment Design (ECD) method to design test questions to evaluate teachers' development of CT practices. This study provided two Teacher Development Courses (TDCs) to enable teachers to teach CT through programming. TDC 1 focused on developing CT concepts, practices and perspectives of teachers, while TDC 2 put emphasis on pedagogies of teaching CT. 80 teachers participated in the two courses. The CT practices tests were administered before the courses, between the two courses and after the courses respectively. Results indicated that CT practices were improved progressively when the in-service teachers attended the two courses. It indicated that it is useful for teachers to experience programming practices in their initial learning as well as during their pedagogical development.},

abstract = {Computational thinking, as coined by Jeannette Wing, is a fundamental skill for all to be able to live in today's world, a mode of thought that goes well beyond computing and provides a framework for reasoning about problems and methods of their solution. It has a long tradition as algorithmic thinking which within computer science is a competence to formulate a solution of a problem in the form of an algorithm and then to implement the algorithm as a computer program. Computational thinking is not an adequate characterization of computer science as claimed by Peter Denning and he is right -- it is a collection of key mental tools and practices originated in computing but addressed to all areas far beyond computer science. As an extension of algorithmic thinking, it includes thinking with many levels of abstraction as a problem solving approach inherently connected to computer science and addressed to all students to use computers and computing skills in solving problems in various school subjects coming from various scientific and applied areas. Computational thinking involves concepts, skills and competences that lie at the heart of computing, such as abstraction, decomposition, generalization, approximation, heuristics, algorithm design, efficiency and complexity issues and therefore it is clear that basic computer science knowledge helps to systematically, correctly, and efficiently process information, perform tasks, and solve problems. Although coming from computer science, computational thinking is not only the study of computer science, though computers play an essential role in the design of problems' solutions. It is a very important and useful mode of thinking in almost all disciplines and school subjects as an insight into what can and cannot be computed.In this talk we shall discuss a new computing curriculum addressed to ALL students in K-12 in Poland which motivates them to use computational thinking in solving problems in various school subjects. Moreover its goal is to encourage and prepare students from early school years to consider computing and related fields as disciplines of their future study and professional career. To this end, the curriculum allows teachers and schools to personalize learning and teaching according to students' interests, abilities, and needs.The new computing curriculum benefits a lot from our experience in teaching informatics in our schools for almost 30 years -- the first curriculum was approved by the ministry of education in 1985, 20 years after the first regular classes on informatics were held in two high schools in Wroc\l{}aw and in Warsaw. Today, informatics is an obligatory subject in middle school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12) and it will replace computer lessons (mainly on ICT) in elementary schools (grades 1-6). The new curriculum is also addressed to vocational education.},

We will discuss our successes and failures, and provide information on our future plans to incorporate more formalized education theory, pedagogy, and research methodology in future years to further this project. Based on our assessment results, we observed statistically significant gains in student self-efficacy with creating computer programs that perform a variety of operations. In addition, students reported a significantly higher understanding of how computer programming can be used in daily life. Our survey also highlighted differences in student self-efficacy between the two interventions, and we discuss possible sources for that result. We discuss observed results based on student groups with various backgrounds, previous STEM experiences, and socioeconomic status.},

However, the relationship of computational thinking to intelligence – seen as the general ability to understand and solve complex problems – is contestable and has not been extensively explored. The present study addressed the question of how computational thinking is related to intelligence. To find an answer to this question, 71 pre-service teacher students completed a survey with 20 Bebras tasks as a measure of computational thinking and a non-verbal intelligence test (TONI-3) to assess their general problem-solving ability. The large and significant correlation of r(70) = .53, p &lt; .001, indicates that both concepts are highly related. Implications of the findings are discussed, including the meaning of the relationship between computational thinking and intelligence during teaching and assessment, and the possibility of more holistic measures of computational thinking that incorporate procedural aspects.},

Students needs to be successful in their context and a possible way to achieve this is by developing the computational thinking. In the last few years there are several initiatives to promote computational thinking and to define approaches and methods to support it. One of this is the unplugged methods, in which students develop computational thinking skills without using the technology. This paper presents an experiment to promote computational thinking by using unplugged methods and employing robots as teachers as an engagement factor for the students. During the experiment, they have been distributed in two groups. One has carried out unplugged activities to develop computational thinking while the other did not. From the experiment, it is possible to see that results are better for those students that have completed unplugged activities and there are differences depending on age.},

CyberPLAYce finds inspiration in the concept of child-computer interaction, where meaning is constructed through spatially reconfiguring the physical environment. The novel aspect of CyberPLAYce is its extension of cyber-learning to the dimension of space where children construct meaning at a larger physical scale. This paper outlines the motivations for CyberPLAYce, focuses on the full arc of design and evaluation activities concerning computational thinking (CT) practices that engaged 8-12-year-old storytellers, and concludes with a consideration of future work focusing on spatial thinking with CyberPLAYce. Results from our empirical study suggest that cyber-physical play afforded by CyberPLAYce scaffolds computational thinking, creating, and sharing in children. Particularly for IDC researchers in the educational domain, CyberPLAYce represents a Research-through-design exemplar supporting children's enjoyment of learning and meaning-construction.},

abstract = {Pedagogic Conversational Agents are interactive systems that teach by talking to the students. They have been used in several domains to develop competences such as storytelling or negotiation from University to Pre-Primary Education. However, in the literature, no cases of using agents for teaching programming to develop computational thinking in children have been found. In the last decades, there is a growing interest in developing computational thinking in children. According to some authors, if children develop computational thinking, they will be able to solve not only computer problems but their daily life problems in a better way. It is under research which educational technologies and methodologies can be more adequate depending on the context to achieve this goal. In this paper, it is proposed, for the first time, the use of Pedagogic Conversational Agents to develop computational thinking in children. Given the complexity of designing this new type of agent, and as it has been done in previous occasions when trying to design a new agent, the MEDIE methodology will be followed to eventually integrate the agent into the classrooms.},

abstract = {Trastea.club (http://www.trastea.club/) is an initiative of the University of Deusto (Spain) aimed to develop STEM-related skills among young students (STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Science). We chose the name "trastea" because it means to tinker in Spanish, a verb that fits with the hands-on approach of this initiative. Since January 2014, we have organized more than 180 workshops attended by more than 3.200 students from 35 different schools. With the aim of supporting the methodological and technical changes needed to integrate these new skills in the classroom, 216 teachers also benefited from our training courses, consultancy and support to adapt Trastea.club's activities to their curricula. Initiatives such as Trastea.club aim to support the constant adaptation process faced by schools and teachers due to the rapidly changing technologies and the evolution of students' profiles. The main goal of this initiative is to help schools in their constant adaptation processes towards the new digital literacy1.},

abstract = {This paper intends to share both the experience of teachers and document the research of the design, implementation, and evaluation of a massive open online course (MOOC). The primary purpose of the MOOC was to do outreach and build community to interest teachers from any discipline in Puerto Rico to incorporate Computational Thinking (CT) into their curriculum and peak their interest in Computer Science Education (CSE). Additional objectives were to use CT as a way to build self-efficacy in high school teachers as integrators of this newly gained knowledge while investigators learned the state of CSE and technology integration in schools of Puerto Rico. The MOOC titled Integrating Computational Thinking into the Curriculum was the first free online Professional Development offered to educators in Puerto Rico and has served as the launching board for the Computer Science Teachers' Association (CSTA) in Puerto Rico. This paper will describe the course's development, content and pertinent activities as they relate to the established goals of the project. Finally, it will share some vignettes of the educators' experiences as well as the results of a survey that was administered to 164 participants of the MOOC in its second rendition and had a 32\% response rate.},

abstract = {End-user game design affords teachers a unique opportunity to integrate computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. However, it is not always apparent in game and simulation projects what computational thinking-related skills students have acquired. Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA) enables teachers to visualize which of nine specific skills students have mastered in game design that can then be used to create simulations. CTPA has the potential to automatically recognize and calculate student computational thinking skills, as well as to map students' computational thinking skill progression, as they proceed through the curriculum. The current research furthers knowledge of CTPA by exploring its validity based on how its performance correlates to human grading of student games. Initial data from this validation study indicates that CTPA correlates well with human grading and that it can even be used to predict students' future achievement levels given their current skill progression, making CTPA a potentially invaluable computational thinking evaluation tool for teachers.},

Computing "matters" because quantitative reasoning, computational thinking, and multi-scale modeling are the intellectual "heart and soul" of 21st Century science and therefore are the essential skills of the 21st Century workforce. Computing "matters" because we can apply the power of dynamic, visual, and interactive computing to reach a deeper understanding of models across math and science while exploring their role in understanding our world.},

abstract = {The participation of girls and women is fundamental in solving problems that the society demands. Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) constitutes an essential set of skills and practices that all students should learn in order to effectively and meaningfully participate in an increasingly computational world. This paper introduces Sphero.Math, a curriculum that integrates CT concepts and practices into 4th-grade mathematics classrooms using the Sphero robot. Sphero.Math was co-designed with school district partners in such a way as to achieve two central design goals. First, integrate CT and mathematics in a mutually-supportive way, meaning that learners engage with CT as a means to deepen mathematics learning and that mathematics serves as a context to learn CT. Second, create a CT-infused curriculum using existing school/district resources that is designed to fit within the constraints of public school classrooms. Along with introducing Sphero.Math and its design goals, this paper presents empirical evidence for the types of CT and math learning opportunities that Sphero.Math can provide for students. In doing so, this work contributes to our understanding of ways to productively integrate CT into elementary classrooms and advances our understanding of how to work within existing educational infrastructure to provide effective and equitable CT learning opportunities for all students.},

abstract = {The term computational thinking has received some discussion in the field of computer science education research. The term is defined as the concept of thinking about problems in a way that can be implemented in a computing device. Of course, after having thought about a problem using computational thinking skills, the next step should be to use programming skills to implement the solution. This work in progress is exploring ways in which programming can be employed as a tool to teach computational thinking and problem solving. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals from various industries. They are purposively selected because of their knowledge of or interest in the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, and the teaching of programming. This data is analyzed within the paradigm of the grounded theory approach. The results of an initial analysis imply an ordering of complexity associated with computational thinking skills, imply connections between computational thinking skills and programming activities, and imply a relationship between computational thinking skills and other taxonomies of learning.},

This project examines how Computational Thinking (CT) skills align to the abilities and interests of young children and can be integrated with other STEM learning activities in order to promote school readiness. The goals of the project are to (1) build a knowledge base on how CT can be promoted in early childhood through integration with mathematics and science, (2) develop learning blueprints to guide the development of integrated classroom and family resources, and (3) develop and evaluate prototype activities to identify design principles useful to future development efforts integrating CT and STEM in early childhood. In this work, a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in CT, early science and mathematics, technology and media, and home and school learning partners with preschool educators and parents to co-design and pilot test prototype activities. Emerging prototypes presented integrate fundamental science and mathematics concepts and practices with CT skills such as problem decomposition, logical and algorithmic thinking, abstraction and debugging. They include hands-on activities with manipulatives familiar to young children and developmentally appropriate technology with unique affordances for complementing and reinforcing the learning that occurs during hands-on experiences. With a goal of addressing CS For All, the co-design, development and pilot testing of prototype activities aim to take into account the needs and strengths of preschool programs and families from low-income and culturally diverse communities.},

The goals of this sensor immersion unit are to help students understand why and how to use sensor and visualization technology as a powerful data-driven tool for scientific inquiry in ways that align with modern scientific practice. The sensor immersion unit is anchored in the investigation of classroom data where students engage with the sensor technology to ask questions about and design displays of the collected data. Students first generate questions about how data data displays work and then proceed through a set of programming exercises to help them understand how to collect and display data collected from their classrooms by building their own mini data displays. Throughout the unit students draw and update their hand drawn models representing their current understanding of how the data displays work. The sensor immersion unit was implemented by ten middle school science teachers during the 2019/2020 school year. Student drawn models of the classroom data displays from four of these teachers were analyzed to examine students' understandings in four areas: function of sensor components, process models of data flow, design of data displays, and control of the display. Students showed the best understanding when describing sensor components. Students exhibited greater confusion when describing the process of how data streams moved through displays and how programming controlled the data displays.},

Results show a moderate increase in minimum spanning tree performance; however, differences between gender, collaboration method, and game genre preference are apparent.

Among choices of tools and platforms, MIT App Inventor is a popular mobile app development environment particularly suitable for engaging novice learners. Users are able to create their own mobile apps with real-world usefulness without having to deal with difficult language syntax. However, a study of computational thinking assessment showed students had difficulties in learning abstract concepts such as procedure and flow control using App Inventor [1]. Meanwhile, non-CS major students demonstrated a lack of continuous growth in computational thinking skills compared to CS major students [1]. In another recent study [2], students reported increased interests in computing after being exposed to modern responsive web development, but it is unclear if having an HTML/CSS background makes it more effective in learning abstract computational concepts when using App Inventor.},

abstract = {If computer science programs face a challenge of convincing students that programming is fun and achievable, they have nothing on mathematics departments who face societal beliefs that math is hard and scary. Several movements in computer science education have focused on broadening participation within computer science and across disciplines. The "CS + X" efforts have focused on helping computer science integrate into other disciplines. The "CS For All" movement has highlighted the importance of providing high quality computing education for all students. Simultaneously, there is increasing attention to the need to provide general education alternatives to college algebra. This paper describes a course designed to combine these goals: a course that uses programming to introduce students to functions, patterns, and spatial and computational thinking in order to meet quantitative reasoning goals set by the university. The course initially used Bricklayer as the programming environment, then transitioned to Processing. Students were successful in writing programs that created art, demonstrated mastery of quantitative literacy, and had improved attitudes following the course. This project suggests that in addition to the creation of introductory computer science classes, courses which embed computer science into disciplinary requirements can be a successful pathway to expand opportunities for students to learn computing.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is currently being introduced into formal education in many European countries. This has stimulated research on how to introduce computational thinking and programming in primary school and in early childhood education. This study describes a work in progress that aims to verify the potential of a programmable educational robot, Cubetto, for 5-6 year-old children in enhancing their classroom activities. The study was carried out in two Italian kindergartens (42 children) and one primary school (21 children). Preliminary results show that the efficacy of Cubetto is strongly dependent on the context of use during classroom activities. The degree of children's attention (in terms of duration) depends on the teacher's ability in involving and supporting children during tasks performed with Cubetto.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study using a robotics platform for teaching computing and cybersecurity concepts to high school students. 38 students attended a week-long camp, starting with projects such as a simulation-only game and a simple autonomous driving program for the robots in order to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) and networking skills. They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange and sequence numbers. We used an evidence-centered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework engaged students and supported their overall learning, but our intervention needs to be modified to help students learn networking concepts},

abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative for elementary computing instruction to support a variety of learners. TIPP&amp;SEE is a meta-cognitive learning strategy that scaffolds student learning when learning from example code. Results from a previous study show statistically-significant performance differences favoring students using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy on a written assessment. In this work, our goal is gain insight as to it why such dramatic learning differences may have occurred. We analyze the students' computational artifacts and TIPP&amp;SEE worksheets. Artifact analysis reveals that students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group are more thorough in their work, completing more elements of the required tasks. In addition, they build open-ended projects with longer scripts that utilize more learned blocks. Worksheet analysis shows that students were highly accurate on some types of questions but largely skipped others. Despite these positive behaviors, there was little statistical correlation between student worksheet correctness, project completion, and written assessment performance. Therefore, while students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group performed actions we believe lead to more success, no individual actions directly explain the results. Like other meta-cognitive strategies, the value of TIPP&amp;SEE may lie in cognitive processes not directly observable, and may vary based upon individual student differences.},

abstract = {As many school districts nationwide continue to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the K-8 level, it is crucial that we understand the factors and skills, such as reading and math proficiency, that contribute to the success of younger learners in a computing curriculum and are typically developed at this age. Yet, little is known about the relationship between reading and math proficiency, and the learning of key CS concepts at the elementary level. This study focused on 4th-grade students (ages 9-10) who were taught events, sequence, and repetition through an adaptation of the Creative Computing Curriculum. While all students benefited from access to such a curriculum, there were statistically-significant differences in learning outcomes, especially between students whose reading and math proficiency are below grade-level, and students whose proficiency are at or above grade-level. This performance gap suggests the need for curricular improvement and learning strategies that are CS specific for students who struggle with reading and math.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) and related concepts, as programming and algorithmic thinking, have been recently advocated as abilities that are as fundamental as numeracy and literacy, and many countries all over the world are introducing programming activities in education. In Italy, even if the introduction of CT and programming in schools is on the pipeline of policy makers, they have not yet been included in the curriculum guidelines. Consequently, there is a strong case for analyzing how programming can be integrated at early stages into the Italian compulsory education. Starting from the constructivist tradition, a study spanning over several school years has been organized aiming at defining and testing a programming learning path for primary schools. The learning path takes into account children's interests, stimulating their passions and creativity. Students are engaged on projects that are meaningful for them, while teachers take advantage of the situations that spontaneously arise to guide students' attention on specific computational concepts. The learning path is being iteratively refined through a field experiment involving a primary school over a four year period. The study aims to the following questions:• Under which conditions can age-appropriate programming activities, allowing for individual differences in learning styles and approaches, work in primary school?• Which indications can the work performed provide to the sustainability of the programming activities when the researchers' support will come to an end?• Which elements of the study can provide suggestions for a wider introduction of programming in primary schools?Since the study is currently in its third year, this paper addresses the first two research question, while only some initial considerations are provided for the third one.},

These 'smells' can be caused by a lack of abstraction, a skill that plays a key role in computer science and computational thinking. We created Pirate Plunder, a novel educational block-based programming game, that aims to teach children to reduce smells by reusing code in Scratch. This work describes an experimental study designed to measure the efficacy of Pirate Plunder with children aged 10 and 11. The findings were that children who played the game were then able to use custom blocks (procedures) to reuse code in Scratch, compared to non-programming and programming control groups.},

Recent studies have highlighted the potential benefits of introducing CT concepts at an early stage. Robots are an engaging and effective educational tool for teaching CT to young children, providing hands-on and interactive learning experiences. Entirely tangible robotic environments have successfully connected the abstract world of CT with the concrete world of preschoolers. Children can program robots by pressing buttons, drawing the path or using code cards. However, there is limited research on the use of commercial robots in preschool classrooms. This research aims to address this gap by investigating preschool teachers’ perspectives on the advantages, challenges, and opportunities associated with using commercial robots in the context of kindergarten classrooms. We contribute with a list of practical, pedagogical and motivational aspects that should be taken into account while evaluating robots and design considerations to build robotic environments for kindergarten classrooms.},

abstract = {Games have been used for a few decades in research, formal education, and training of children and adults, and digital games are no strangers to educational uses. After all, everyone likes to play games, so it should stand to reason that educational digital games are going to be a hit. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, educational digital games are often criticized for being too focused on educational content and not enough on engaging, challenging, and entertaining players. Making games for entertainment is difficult and requires multidisciplinary expertise. Making educational games that are engaging and entertaining is also difficult and requires additional input from educators and domain experts, and rigorous evaluation methodologies, all of which must revolve around the players. In this position article, we introduce the early stage “EduGames: Play to Learn” research project aimed at supporting the public in acquiring Critical and Computational Thinking skills to tackle the problem of detecting misinformation, and supporting the game development and research communities in creating and evaluating games that are entertaining and educational. As part of this project, we call for more, and more structured, synergy between academia, educators, and the game development industry.},

abstract = {Given the importance of the introductory programming course (CS1), the Computer Science Education community has devoted a significant effort to generate empirical evidence and propose tools, techniques, and curricular approaches to support students. For instance, Parsons Problems have emerged as one of the preferred scaffolding strategies to help CS1 students get a grasp on programming before being exposed to open write-code assignments. However, prior literature has not given enough attention to those students who fail CS1 and must retake the course. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory case study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of Parsons Problems as an active scaffolding strategy delivered to CS1 retakers at the University of Chile. In this version of the course, although students were already introduced to computational thinking, program design, and coding (as they were taking CS1 for a second time), it was the first time they were exposed to Parsons Problems. We conducted a follow-up assessment of the students' perceptions throughout the course, employing a combination of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and end-course surveys. Our results suggest that Parsons Problems are effective for learners beyond the ''novice programmer'' stage (such as the experience of CS1 retakers), highlighting good practices to support the studied group in terms of engagement, performance, and overall student experience.},

Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years. The poster has two components. First, through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP. It focuses on the RPP's origin in leveraging the districts' existing relationship with Pennsylvania's South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation's leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing. The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework. Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19 most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly. Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {Collaborative mobile augmented reality (MAR) has emerged as a promising tool in the field of education. This technology enables multiple users to interact with digital content overlaid on the physical world through their mobile devices. Collaborative MAR combined with tangible elements enhances learning by integrating physical objects that can be manipulated and interacted with in the augmented reality environment, providing a hands-on and immersive educational experience. This study explores the impact of tangible mobile augmented reality on collaboration and object manipulation. Our goal is to understand how mobile devices’ manipulation affects collocated students' collaboration in tangible MAR in terms of ease of use and collaboration. The study involves participants working in pairs to facilitate collaboration through a MAR game for developing the computational thinking skills of primary school students. Our goal is to compare the perceived behaviors and interactions that emerged in two distinct MAR settings: (1) Stand-mounted device condition, where the device is fixed on a mobile stand, and (2) Hand-held device condition, where the device is held by one of the team's players. The same task is simulated in both settings to allow for direct comparison. The results of this study can help inform the design and development of future MAR systems and provide insights into the potential benefits and challenges in terms of collaboration and object manipulation.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {Educators should provide access to all students with inclusive and equitable computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) learning outcomes. Yet access to CS and CT is not always available for students with disabilities. This qualitative cross-case study examined the barriers and strengths three exemplar teachers faced, explored the supports and resources they provided, and presented how these teachers defined successful inclusive CS learning outcomes for their students. The data set included analysis of the semistructured teachers' interviews and teaching materials. The results included seven successful strategies the teachers identified: 1) using physical computing, 2) pair programming, 3)connecting CS and Individual Education Plans (IEP), 4)applying hands-on activities, 5) CT integration, 6) using CS vocabulary, and 7)open-ended pedagogy. Three resources and supports the teacher provided emerged from the data set as follows: 1) accessible instructional materials, 2) projects with multiple entry points, and 3) essential scaffolding supports. Whereas four barriers teachers faced; 1. subject matter, 2) accessible tools, 3) students receiving support, 3) the role of CS in instruction, and 4) the role of time served as additional findings. The results suggested that school-based practitioners, including administrators, can overcome the barriers and promote successful strategies that lead to asset-based CS-inclusion in the classroom.},

abstract = {This experience report describes an approach for helping elementary schools integrate computational thinking and coding by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure that do not rely on 1-1 computing. A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon "unplugged" knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by pre- and post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations.},

In this article we take a look at task group which connects computer science concepts with computational thinking - graph tasks (for example trees, graphs, square grids, graph algorithms...). We focused on the three lowest categories of the Slovak contest, which include pupils of the whole primary school (aged 8 to 15) and analysed the tasks of the last four years. We used both qualitative and quantitative data analysis research methods. Task were divided into subcategories which were further analysed, focusing on identification of the specifics of the tasks in which there were significant differences between boys and girls. Using comparative analysis, it was found that boys are better in tasks with simple (relatively abstract) representation of the structure which is described by a larger amount of text, but the main point of the task is to identify the problem and create or uncover a strategy for finding a solution. Girls' performance is better in tasks that have less text, relatively more complicated representation of the structure and are focused on simple operations at graphs or reading them.},

abstract = {Culturally responsive computing scholars often use the metaphor and heuristic of intersectionality to address issues of race and gender in research with Black, Brown, and Indigenous children in U.S. K12 computer science (CS) education. This has led to critical analyses that reveal the inequitable conditions that children of color face in CS education. Intersectionality has also supported curricular innovations and interventions that aim to make CS education more equitable by being responsive to children's identities and communities. However, the concept of class has received less attention than race and gender by culturally responsive computing scholars who draw on intersectionality in their CS education research. How might class fit into intersectional research and theory in culturally responsive computing scholarship? The objective of this paper is to answer this question with a proof-of-concept study that tests the feasibility of what we call worker-driven computing education. We introduce findings from our research and collaborations with current, once, and retired autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan to define the computational thinking idea of automation from their perspectives. Through analyzing qualitative data, a worker-driven definition of automation was developed by drawing on autoworker-expertise about the points of production in the auto-industry. Our findings reveal how this definition focuses on introducing automation in the context of lifelong learning about how to communicate and work across divisions of labor to make workplaces safe, healthy, and efficient.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing recognition of the importance of enabling K-12 students to engage in computational thinking, particularly in elementary grades where students' dispositions toward STEM are developing. Block-based programming has emerged as an effective tool for engaging these novice learners in computational thinking. At the same time, digital storytelling has emerged as a promising avenue for creating motivating problem-solving scenarios that engage students in science investigations. Although block-based programming and digital storytelling are in many ways synergistic, there is a lingering question of how to design block-based languages at an age-appropriate level to enable effective and engaging storytelling. In this work, we review design principles from prior block-based and digital storytelling systems as well as propose the design of block-based programming language features to enable the creation of rich, interactive science narratives by upper elementary students.},

abstract = {School systems globally have begun to integrate computational thinking (CT) practices into elementary teaching and learning standards to provide young students with a comfort for and foundational understanding of computer science. This integration requires educating teachers to develop and implement CT learning opportunities. Our work contributes to best practice by exploring the role language plays in elementary teachers' discussions and development of CT-infused science lessons. To do this, we captured and analyzed the language used by elementary teachers as they spoke and wrote about CT in a multi-week professional development experience during which the teachers created and delivered CT-infused lessons to their students. We determined that teachers exhibited differing CT conceptualizations, which we categorized from broad to narrow. These differences were not, however, observed in either their spoken or written language. While there were instances of teachers using language that mirrored how the facilitators discussed CT, this use did not align with how they conceptualized CT. Our work analyzing connections between CT language use and CT conceptualization suggests that in order to understand how teachers are conceptualizing CT, professional development designers and teacher educators should focus on creating opportunities for teachers to employ CT practices in context rather than relying only on language. We feel this will support a more precise and nuanced engagement with CT.},

abstract = {Dialog with a social pedagogical robot or agent is a powerful way for kids to learn [1, 5] but may limit the formation of an agentic relationship with the technology [9]. One main purpose of conversational agents is to allow the user to have a natural interaction that reduces the need to learn artificial conventions [6], but dialog systems fall short with respect to failure recovery, vocabulary diversity, remembering conversational history, and other measures [2, 3]. Further, Hill et. al. [4] found that people adapt their model of communication to match a chatbot’s in the same way they do with a child or non-native speaker. Thus, users conversing with a pedagogical agent are implicitly trained to shape their behavior to suit the technology rather than shaping the technology. For young learners, particularly among populations that have been historically excluded from technology fields, this limits agency and reinforces marginalizing power structures [9]. This project combines a conversational agent with ideas of agentic engagement to help middle-school-aged children learn computational thinking. Agentic engagement is defined as students’ constructive contribution into the flow of instruction and includes behaviors such as expressing interests, preferences, and opinions. It has been positively correlated to learning performance and motivation [7, 8]. Combined with a culturally responsive curriculum (CRC), agentic engagement may help to foster an agentic relationship with technology. Our system encourages learners to engage agentically by using programming constructs to change the agent’s vocabulary, recognizing the intent behind a user utterance (an invocation), and defining the action the agent will take to respond to an invocation. Students use computational thinking concepts such as pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition to convert ideas into commands for the dialog system and to understand which of their ideas can’t be programmed with the technology as presented. They learn both to personalize the system today and to see the agent as a technosocial construct that they can shape in the future.  Programming can be accomplished either using Google’s Blockly visual programming tool (https://developers.google.com/blockly) or through conversation with the agent itself. The agent is embodied as a robot character, so agent actions can be verbal, physical, or both. Through social dialog with the agent, learners reflect on how computational thinking is relevant to themselves and their communities as part of a CRC, building on the work of Stewart et. al. [10]. For example, learners may be asked to reflect on the relationship between greeting behaviors and identity. After designing a greeting interaction, learners program the dialog system to achieve the greeting. Then learners may be asked to imagine how they might hypothetically enhance the dialog system to make it even more capable of implementing their preferences. In parallel to the development of the dialog system and curriculum, we will also adapt Reeve’s agentic engagement instrument [7] for CRC. Our contributions will include this instrument, insights into the relationship between agentic engagement and an agentic relationship with technology, and insights into how a programmable dialog system impacts agentic engagement and learning computational thinking.},

Both of these techniques have been used by the M&amp;S community to model high-level "soft systems" and discrete events. However, they have not been used to teach physics and represent ways in which M&amp;S can improve physics education. We introduce the NSF-sponsored STEPP project along with its hypothesis and goals.

abstract = {As an important means to improve teenagers' computational thinking, programming education has been paid more and more attention. But the traditional teaching mode of programming course is boring and abstract, which makes learners lack motivation and enthusiasm for learning. Therefore, learning methods based on digital games may be a potential optimization strategy. This paper proposes a learning method based on digital games and conducts a quasi-experimental study in a senior high school in China. The experimental group was placed in a learning method based on digital games to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning method and game learning behavior, while the control group used traditional classroom teaching methods for learning. The results showed that the experimental group was better than the control group in learning experience, learning interest, collaborative learning ability and learning performance. It provides a valuable reference for Game-based programming teaching and research.Keywords: Digital game-based learning, Programming education, Teaching process},

Computational design refers to creating new computational tools and methods that are adopted by the members of a community to address their concerns. Unfortunately, the definitions of both "thinking" and "doing" are fuzzy and have allowed misconceptions about the nature of algorithms. Fortunately, it is possible to eliminate the fuzziness in the definitions by focusing on computational design, which is at the intersection between thinking and doing.

During the first year, 2017–2018, 2900 students participated in a pilot phase. 7320 students participated in the implementation phase throughout the course of the academic years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 in 2018. The program consisted of a free, two-hour camp that was delivered on-site at the school and exposed children to a variety of computing topics, including addressing misconceptions about computing, learning how to code, and investigating computational thinking. Schools self-selected, and the initiative reached several schools in every county in Ireland, as well as schools with a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and gender diversity. The primary school students’ ages ranged from third class (7–8 years old) to sixth year (17–18 years old) at second level. This paper focuses specifically on the research data collected during the implementation phase (N=1202) from the secondary school students (12 - 18 years old) not enrolled in the formal Leaving Certificate Computer Science subject. Looking at student perceptions of Computer Science and if the outreach positively impacted those perceptions and if it built student interest in pursuing further study in Computer Science.},

abstract = {Introducing computational thinking in primary school curricula implies that teachers have to prepare appropriate lesson material. Typically this includes creating programming tasks, which may overwhelm primary school teachers with lacking programming subject knowledge. Inadequate resulting example code may negatively affect learning, and students might adopt bad programming habits or misconceptions. To avoid this problem, automated program analysis tools have the potential to help scaffolding task creation processes. For example, static program analysis tools can automatically detect both good and bad code patterns, and provide hints on improving the code. To explore how teachers generally proceed when creating programming tasks, whether tool support can help, and how it is perceived by teachers, we performed a pre-study with 26 and a main study with 59 teachers in training and the LitterBox static analysis tool for Scratch. We find that teachers in training (1) often start with brainstorming thematic ideas rather than setting learning objectives, (2) write code before the task text, (3) give more hints in their task texts and create fewer bugs when supported by LitterBox, and (4) mention both positive aspects of the tool and suggestions for improvement. These findings provide an improved understanding of how to inform teacher training with respect to support needed by teachers when creating programming tasks.},

abstract = {The Idaho Elementary Computer Science (CS) Collaborative (IECC) is a researcher-practitioner partnership dedicated to understanding how to better support the predominately rural districts in Idaho to implement elementary CS education. As part of the IECC's work, we conducted a survey of elementary teachers across the state. This poster will present our initial findings. Two of the research questions we addressed via the survey are: (1) What factors would motivate Idaho elementary teachers to pursue professional development (PD) related to CS? (2) What are elementary teachers' perceptions of the value of connecting CS education to rural community economies and industries? Descriptive analyses of 309 survey responses suggest that about three-quarters of elementary teachers reported that the following factors would be at least somewhat influential in their decisions to pursue CS PD: a K-5 computational thinking requirement, a district-wide CS planning staff, a pathway for elementary teachers to earn a certification in CS teaching, and a way to request CS PD funding. Few (9\%) Idaho elementary teachers found that the perception of a disconnect between CS education and rural community interests was a significant barrier to elementary CS education. Even so, over 70\% of them were moderately to strongly interested in mechanisms for connecting their CS education efforts to rural community industries through guest speakers and industry partnerships. The poster will discuss the implications of these and other emerging findings from the teacher survey, as well as IECC's related surveys of Idaho district superintendents and elementary school principals.},

abstract = {The association between mathematics and programming in an educational context is not new. Today, programming has been introduced into curricula worldwide for younger children. In the Swedish case, primary school teachers are expected to integrate programming in mathematics education from autumn 2018. However, Swedish teachers' knowledge of programming and programming didactics is limited. Meanwhile, there is little research on K-9 programming education. This has led to the dilemma that the mathematics teachers have limited support in didactic knowledge and good examples. This study reports on a teacher professional development project in programming. More specifically, teachers used Lesson Study to plan, execute, and evaluate lessons that integrated programming into various school subjects in elementary school. This study analyzed the didactic strategies developed in 10 lesson studies, as well as mapped the opportunities and challenges of pupils' learning in the mathematics subject. The result was the identification of three didactic strategies, which were analog programming, robot programming and block programming, as well as 11 didactic methods applied within these strategies. The paper contributes with examples of the didactic methods that teachers have developed and evaluated using lesson study. The paper further provides insights on how teachers can take progression into account by applying the three didactic strategies. At last but not least, the study shows a great need for teachers to develop computational thinking abilities.},

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for integrating science and computational thinking teaching using Logic Programming. We then develop and implement two 8-session integration modules on chemistry and physics for 6th and 7th graders. Pre- and post- tests, class observations and interviews show the feasibility of the framework in terms of 1) development and implementation of the modules, and 2) the students' learning outcomes on science content and Computational Thinking, and their acceptance of the integration.},

Here, we examine how bilingual learners translanguage while learning computer science. These middle schoolers participated in a curricular intervention which infused computational thinking into their Spanish-English bilingual language arts class. Through a descriptive qualitative methodology, we document classroom moments supporting four claims: 1) students' translanguaging blurs linguistic, disciplinary, and modal boundaries, 2) computational literacies are intertwined with students' other literacies, 3) students' attitudes about language and the contexts around them play a role in their translanguaging, and 4) students translanguage to engage in specific CT practices.},

abstract = {With the increased demand for introducing computational thinking (CT) in K-12 classrooms, educational researchers are developing integrated lesson plans that can teach CT fundamentals in non-computing specific classrooms. Although these lessons reach more students through the core curriculum, proper evaluation methods are needed to ensure the quality of the design and integration. As part of a research practice partnership, we work to infuse research-backed curricula into science courses. We find a three-pronged approach of evaluation can help us make better decisions on how to improve experimental curricula for active classrooms. This CEO model uses three data sources (student code traces, exit ticket responses, and field observations) as a triangulated approach that can be used to identify programming behavior among novice developers, preferred task ordering for the assignment, and scaffolding recommendations to teachers. This approach allows us to evaluate the practical implementations of our initiative and create a focused approach for designing more effective lessons.},

abstract = {This demo introduces a hands-on robotics module designed to cultivate AI literacy in elementary students through computational thinking and robotics. Co-designed with 20 elementary school teachers and instructional coaches, the module helps students differentiate between artificial intelligence and human intelligence, focusing on the AI4K12 Big Idea of Perception, and specifically how our senses differ from a robot's sensors. The centerpiece of the curriculum is the "alien planet" task, where students program a robot to explore an unseen planet created by a peer, using its sensors to identify objects like "aliens" (green), "water" (blue), and "unique materials" (red). This activity not only builds critical thinking and problem-solving skills but also introduces foundational AI concepts, such as how machines perceive the world differently than humans. By connecting to other subjects like art (e.g., hue values) and linking to students' real-world experiences, the module offers a truly interdisciplinary and relevant approach to early AI education.},

abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have worked to bring computer science to all students. However, CS is still an inequitable field. When developing curricula, we must account for the importance of connecting the lives and identities of historically marginalized students with instructional materials. We examine the knowledge and experiences that elementary (age 9-10) students drew upon to implement an open-ended programming assignment about themselves. We coded the Scratch projects of 189 students to investigate what aspects of their lives students reference, and how they use various modalities in Scratch to create digital media products about themselves. In our data, we found that the most common spheres portrayed were identity, hobbies and leisure, and interests. When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity. Additionally, our findings add to previous literature on Scratch as an effective platform for digital media production. In particular, we found that students used dialogue, images, sound, and the title to represent their spheres of influence through programming multimedia and interactive projects. This work has implications for the development of curricula and teaching guides for upper elementary students courses on computational thinking. Spheres of influence could inform researchers on the most influential aspects of students life in a specific context, providing elements for creating culturally relevant and interest-based materials and lessons.},

abstract = {Educational robotics, in which students program a physical robot to interact with the real world, can provide tangible active learning opportunities that are often linked to increases in student computational thinking, creativity, and motivation. To date, ER has focused on the use of robots to augment learning of adjacent fields (e.g., mathematics, programming, digital media) for K--12 students. As a result, we lack ER guidelines for: (1) supporting college robotics students learning the discipline of robotics itself and (2) college robotics students, who may possess distinct abilities and needs compared to K--12 students. To address this gap, we present a semester-long exploration of a college-levelIntroduction to Robotics course. Through student feedback, we identified three themes: (1) Positive learning opportunities, (2) Dealing with uncertainty, and (3) Successful results with simple solutions. and provide guidelines for improving ER in the context of college students learning to program and debug robots for the first time. We detail these themes and provide guidelines for improving ER in the context of college students learning to program and debug robots for the first time.},

abstract = {Decomposition is considered one of the four cornerstones of computational thinking, which is essential to software development [36]. It requires the ability to assess a problem at a high level, develop a strategy to combat it, and then design a solution. Our study focuses on the metacognitive aspect of decomposition. We try to understand the learner's thought process and, specifically, what makes the novice programmer decide to break down a function.Researchers have studied decomposition in introductory programming courses through guided experiments, case studies, and surveys[23,37]. In this work, we follow a different, more scalable approach. We develop an automated system to analyze 45,000 code snapshots from 168 students for a challenging CS1 programming assignment, detect the pivotal moments when they decide to decompose their programs, and identify what drives their decisions from the code. We then classify the students and study the relationship between the different categories, the code complexity, and the time to derive the final solution. We evaluate the impact of decomposition on the student's performance in the assignment and the course exams. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for computing education.},

Objects in early childhood environments often share space between adults’ and children's objectives. By considering these objects as boundary objects, designers are led to explore how children appropriate objects for playful learning activities beyond adult objectives. This paper discusses Wobblies (see Figure 1), a novel technology probe, to interrogate how a socially-motivated design with conditional and positional interactive behaviour was understandable to children, and how they appropriated the probe in playful activities. We deployed the probe in a rural Australian preschool in a free-play environment. Initial observational findings show that the children understood the procedure of the interactions and moved from exploring to constructive play activities.},
